// Package robot provides machine-readable output for AI agents.
// schema_pagination.go is the SINGLE canonical declaration point for
// per-surface pagination flags (WS0-G6 / bd-ws3-contract-breadth-psvyu.1).
//
// Every list-shaped registered schema type (a type with at least one direct,
// JSON-visible slice field that is not []byte) MUST appear in SchemaPagination
// exactly once, flagged either:
//
//   - Paginated: true  — the surface implements the offset/limit pagination
//     contract: a *PaginationInfo `json:"pagination"` field plus
//     _agent_hints.next_offset (see pagination.go).
//   - Paginated: false — UNPAGINATED BY DESIGN; Reason records why (bounded
//     cardinality, per-request result echo, cursor-based continuation, ...).
//
// SchemaPaginationViolations enforces exhaustiveness and contract fidelity by
// walking the schema registry; conformance tests in internal/robot and
// internal/cli fail on any unflagged list type, stale flag, or flagged-true
// type missing the contract fields. New envelope types are therefore covered
// at registration time by construction.
