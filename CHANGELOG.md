## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **Qualified Codex joins the ordinary shared provider controls.** The pinned
  runtime loads a restricted tool catalog so model metadata cannot re-enable
  file patching independently of the shell flag. Offline checks load the actual
  configuration in that executable. Successful terminal events, exact served
  model, independent verification and cleanup are required for completion;
  stale verification, later edits and duplicate terminal events are rejected.

- **Shared workspace completion requires independent proof.** Grok and Z.ai
  ordinary controls supplement their signed runtime receipts with a separately
  signed controller verification after cleanup. Redacted observations survive
  signing failure. Historical runtime completion remains visible separately
  from workspace verification; neither grants qualification by itself.

- **Provider experiment budgets survive configuration changes and crashes.**
  Explicit campaigns reserve immutable attempts in a common local ledger.
  Concurrent dispatch cannot exceed the ceiling, and replay never refunds it.
  Increasing a ceiling requires its current value and new authorization evidence.
  Primary comparisons, shared assignments, Grok qualification and Codex runtime
  dispatch use the campaign boundary.

- **Primary profiles and operation histories can move into normal controls.**
  `provider migrate` previews exact identities, copies signed bytes and unknown
  rows unchanged, rejects collisions and backs up configuration before activation.
  `provider readiness` checks runtime pins, credential availability/freshness and
  qualification expiry. Controller tests now include an actual forced process
  kill; reassignment fixtures expose the prompts required by production guards.

- **Primary provider comparisons check executable tool prerequisites before
  dispatch.** Standalone Codex comparisons require a pinned code-mode companion;
  safe warning categories and MCP counters survive failed runs. Durable
  experiment IDs prevent replay and require a digest of the relevant change or
  new diagnostic evidence. `provider acceptance` creates the common isolated
  coding fixture without calling a provider.

- **Qualified Claude workspace assignments use the shared provider controls.**
  Completion requires the controller-owned verifier and signed exact-identity
  evidence. Local cancellation, cleanup, and capacity release permit guarded
  restart; remote generation termination and resume remain unproven. Ordinary
  operation attestations cannot grant workspace qualification. Doctor output
  separates workspace evidence and admission from lifecycle capabilities.
  Expired Claude credential snapshots fail before dispatch. The stream parser
  handles message variants independently, retains closed rejection categories,
  and binds the exact completion instruction through the system-prompt option.
  Ordinary completion combines the runtime's successful terminal event with
  independent workspace verification; echoed nonces remain diagnostic there
  and mandatory in identity qualification. Earlier failed receipts stay failed.

- **Controller crashes preserve uncertain subscription usage.** Reclaiming a
  dead local lease conservatively reserves unreconciled weekly credits. Offline
  crash tests cover reservation, dispatch, signing, and receipt persistence;
  uncertain operations cannot be replayed. Cleanup recognizes processes reaped
  after termination by a signal.

- **Ordinary Grok diagnostics bind the verified executable digest.** Missing
  optional profile hashes cannot break finalization; invalid bindings and
  unavailable diagnostic storage are rejected before dispatch.
  Robot receipt queries preserve signed fields exactly through JSON output.

- **Primary comparisons apply the same served-model gate as Grok.** The exact
  model requires successful terminal acknowledgement and an unconflicted stream.
  Account authority remains explicitly profile-attested and is not inferred
  from a model match. Comparison receipts do not change dispatch admission.

- **Cancelled Grok operations retain signed terminal receipts.** Local signing
  gets a separate ten-second finalization window after provider work stops.
  Signing failures remain uncertain and cannot replay the original assignment.
  The ordinary Grok receipt allowlist now admits its four required digest fields
  while rejecting raw data, missing digests, and recursive signatures.
  Ordinary dispatch checks this signing envelope before starting provider work
  and saves redacted protocol observations before cleanup. Local receipt
  delivery status cannot invalidate signatures; status and restart verify the
  immutable signed outcome before trusting its identity and cleanup evidence.

- **Grok acknowledgement candidates respect response and tool boundaries.**
  Earlier commentary cannot be concatenated with the final nonce, and an early
  acknowledgement cannot authorize later work. Redacted text counters survive
  failures. Guarded restart recognizes Grok's signed ACP cancellation state
  while still requiring verified cleanup and exact local capacity release.
  Primary comparisons use native system search paths for their pinned runtimes
  and broker, excluding inherited Windows interop helpers.

- **Grok workspace tools execute in the controller through the reviewed ACP
  reverse MCP channel.** Qualification and ordinary dispatch share the same
  constrained broker and isolated verifier. A per-run server binding, bounded
  request IDs, replay rejection, and cancellation checks prevent cross-session
  or late tool execution without relaxing Grok's sandbox.

- **Primary comparisons retain a closed terminal-explanation category.**
  Read-only, unavailable-tool, and permission mentions remain diagnostic hints;
  response text is discarded and these hints cannot authorize workspace work.

- **Offline qualification distinguishes an unavailable signer from a key mismatch.**
  A failed local signer lookup keeps admission closed and recommends restoring
  the signer and repeating the offline check, rather than another paid run.

- **Workspace comparisons retain redacted broker observations before cleanup.**
  Per-tool outcomes and error digests survive failed runs without retaining
  arguments or content. MCP request metadata is accepted without changing tool
  authorization or being echoed. Claude comparisons disable the shared Agent
  View supervisor. Trimpath verifier builds require a bound Go toolchain root
  instead of attempting to mount an empty path. The common scenario permits
  runtime tool discovery before its four audited workspace operations. Codex
  requires the bound MCP server and explicitly approves only its exposed tools.

- **Grok failure diagnostics are saved before process cleanup.** Qualification
  checks storage before dispatch, then persists allowlisted method labels,
  request-ID shape, session matching, stage/reason, and counters without payloads.
  Reviewed permission requests can select only `reject_once`; malformed or
  unbound requests remain denied. Callback failures cannot prevent cleanup.
- **Workspace evidence is evaluated independently.** Verified broker edit,
  test, and denial results survive a later protocol failure. The full signed
  operation subset still gates admission; baseline distinguishes passed,
  failed, untested, and unsupported outcomes.
- **Ordinary provider controls use the existing structured adapters.** Exact
  profile selection on assign, send, and one-shot spawn preserves qualification,
  identity, replay, and capacity boundaries. Status/health verify durable
  completion receipts; supported Z.ai resume still requires lifecycle evidence.
  Cross-command cancellation now uses the exact durable operation binding.
  Explicit restart requires a new operation ID, verified terminal outcome,
  cleanup and exact capacity release; unknown outcomes cannot be replayed.
- **Capacity release is independently observable.** Status records the local
  exact/plan lease releases and usage reconciliation without refunding unknown
  reservations or claiming remote generation termination.
- **Primary comparison producers share the workspace fixture.** A pinned
  Codex or Claude profile can run the same audited edit/test/denial scenario.
  Missing account authority, incomplete tool boundaries and unexercised
  lifecycle behavior remain explicit; comparison is not dispatch admission.
- **Grok ACP tool-result arrays preserve lifecycle observations.** The parser
  decodes assistant text only for message chunks; valid tool-content arrays no
  longer discard completion updates or become nonce acknowledgements.

- **Z.ai Codex admission now shares CAAM's v2 manifest contract.** NTM
  recomputes the versioned identity/file digest and strictly validates the
  endpoint, account, model, credential id, bridge path/digest, policy, and
  model catalog before a brokered Coding Plan run. Legacy v1 profiles and
  self-consistent descriptor substitutions fail closed.
- **Provider lifecycle dispatch now uses explicit local guarantees.** Current
  signed crash, cancellation, resume, and process-cleanup evidence is required
  alongside workspace qualification. Remote inference termination remains a
  separate authority report; local cleanup never proves remote billing stopped.
- **Qualification observations survive receipt signing failures.** Before signing,
  NTM flushes a separate unsigned diagnostic record containing fixed check names,
  bounded failure reasons, and identity/evidence digests. Payloads and free-form
  text are excluded. Diagnostic records cannot authorize provider operations.
- Workspace promotion requires cleanup evidence, and Z.ai Codex additionally
  requires capacity accounting. Partial signed model evidence no longer requires
  unrelated lifecycle checks to pass the Z.ai doctor identity gate.
- `provider baseline` inventories the same scenarios for all four providers,
  with exact-profile receipt evidence and no provider calls. Codex and Claude
  are not grandfathered into the new suite by ordinary pane usability. Missing
  evidence, negative checks, and unsupported capabilities remain distinct.
- Grok operation admission accepts its full signed runtime version banner when
  the pinned version token and exact executable digest both match.
- **Pinned Windows receipt signing is descriptor-executed.** WSL opens and
  hashes the root-owned bridge, verifies every parent directory, and executes
  that exact file descriptor, closing the path-replacement interval between
  verification and invocation.

### Fixed

- Grok live qualification now takes one shared capacity lease per provider
  request instead of holding one lease across a multi-turn lineage suite, and
  preserves only an integer JSON-RPC failure code alongside bounded redacted
  failure metadata.
- Grok's typed workspace broker now emits the ACP v1-required empty `env`
  array. Strict ACP agents no longer reject the otherwise valid stdio MCP
  descriptor during `session/new`, and NTM still passes no credential-bearing
  environment entries to the broker.
- Grok ACP initialization now declares NTM's deliberately absent reverse
  filesystem/terminal capabilities and supplies xAI's non-interactive startup
  hints on both initialize and session creation. Grok 1.0.13 therefore blocks
  on MCP initialization before accepting the first workspace prompt instead
  of silently using its progressive interactive startup path.
- Grok ACP now accepts only the reviewed direct and wrapped housekeeping
  notifications emitted by the pinned 1.0.13 runtime while retaining
  request-ID and unknown-method fail-closed checks. MCP progress can no longer
  be mistaken for malformed prompt traffic, while session carriers are bound
  to the active session and contribute no terminal completion evidence.
  The pinned ACP schema's underscore-prefixed flat payloads are accepted
  alongside the reviewed nested leader envelopes; explicit envelope methods
  must still match exactly.
- Grok protocol failures now carry a closed, structured reason into signed
  qualification checks without retaining rejected methods, payloads, session
  identifiers, or provider error text. Unexpected reverse requests and foreign
  standard ACP session updates fail closed with distinct diagnostic reasons.
  The signing bridge validates the same closed vocabulary, and Grok's offline
  preflight exercises a failed diagnostic receipt before admitting a paid turn.

## [v1.31.0] -- 2026-09-01 [GitHub Release]

**Durable agent identity, coordinator/Agent Mail integrity, and the Antigravity/Codex delivery-gate wave** (GitHub issues #262, #263, #265, #266, #268, #269, #270, #271, #273, #277, #285).

### Added

- **Oh My Pi plugin preset** ([#262](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/issues/262)): ships the maintained Oh My Pi preset with a setup guide.
- **Stable pane identity in activity output**: `ntm activity` now emits `window_index` and a stable `pane_id`, so robot-mode consumers can track panes across layout changes.
- **Pane-generation-bound Agent Mail identities**: spawned identities are bound to their pane generation and server receipts are preserved, so a respawned pane can never inherit a predecessor's mail identity.
- **Tool-rejection classification in atomic dispatch**: the coordinator classifies tool rejections during dispatch and streamlines spawn availability checks.

### Fixed

- **Durable agent type** ([GH#268](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/issues/268)): the pane's agent type is recorded on the pane (not just its title) and persists across spawn, add, adopt, controller changes, rotation, profile switch, restore, and restart; the `user` pseudo-type is never stamped as durable.
- **Antigravity support hardening** ([GH#270](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/issues/270), [GH#269](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/issues/269), [GH#271](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/issues/271)): idle and working TUI frames are classified correctly, pinned Antigravity personas pass model validation, `agy` model overrides are rejected with a clear explanation, and error strings are normalized.
- **Codex ultra composer delivery gate** ([#273](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/issues/273)): the delivery gate accepts the Codex ultra composer glyph `»` and rejects dialog frames, so sends no longer stall on Codex ultra.
- **Agent Mail read state** ([#277](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/issues/277)): inbox rows accept `read_ts`, so mail that has been read stops counting as unread; structured pane-binding JSON is decoded to its name and the real coordinator identity is registered.
- **Robot-mode reliability**: completed Beads work is no longer dropped when Agent Mail history is slow; stale errors are debounced only on authoritative live work; mail checks use the configured Agent Mail client; restarts are gated on live pane membership; crash handling runs even for a known-dead PID.
- **Assignment flow**: explicit persona roles are respected when matching work to panes, and stale `bv` plan rows are reconciled against live bead lifecycle instead of failing assignment.
- **Controller safety**: the controller never takes over a running agent's pane, and dashboard mail-client semantics are aligned with it; Grok Build panes are admitted through the shared mail-nudge safety gate.
- **Event bus**: reentrant publishing at capacity no longer deadlocks (non-blocking caller-runs backpressure).
- **Windows**: drive paths serialize as empty-authority SQLite URIs and embedded migration paths are slash-joined, fixing database access on Windows ([#263](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/issues/263) family).
- **Pipeline**: executor snapshot persistence to disk is serialized.
- **Docs/CLI polish**: shipped-plugin send flags parse as optional values; `adopt` help no longer claims 0-based pane indices (honours `pane-base-index`).

---

## [v1.30.0] -- 2026-08-22 [GitHub Release]

**Agent Mail identity integrity + first-class agent plugins** (GitHub issues #256, #257, #258, #260, #261).

### Fixed

- **Live Agent Mail identities are never re-issued** ([#256](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/issues/256)): `ntm add` combined title-derived indexing with a title-first registry lookup, so two live panes could be handed the same identity. The session registry now records pane ids and pids, resolves pane-id-first, and reuses a title only when its holder is provably dead (absent, or present with a different pid); unobservable liveness means "occupied" and a fresh identity is minted. `ntm add` also folds live registry titles into its index allocation.
- **`--worktrees` panes are addressable under both project keys** ([#257](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/issues/257)): spawn published pane identities under the session project key while agents derived theirs from the worktree cwd, so mail addressed one key and agents registered under another. Identities are now published under the session key, its resolved form, and the worktree directory, and `AGENT_MAIL_PROJECT=<session dir>` is injected into worktree panes unless plugin env or `--pane-env` overrides it.
- **The agentmail fallback test can never touch the real `~/.config`** ([#258](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/issues/258)): the test set only `HOME`, but `os.UserConfigDir()` honours `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` first, so `go test ./internal/...` could delete the real config directory. The test is now hermetic (both variables isolated, paths derived from the production resolver, deletion refused unless provably inside the temp sandbox) with regression tests pinning the containment.
- **Corrected commit provenance.** Commit `d08893d9`'s message incorrectly attributed the fail-closed serve safety-policy change to its completion and tmux diff. The actual safety-policy implementation is `dda4aae8`; history is preserved and this note is the forward correction.

### Added

- **OpenCode parity** ([#261](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/issues/261)): readiness/working detection for the OpenCode TUI, `ntm send --oc`/`--grok` targeting, a deps probe, `models.default_opencode`, and a registration fallback (`<program>/cli-default`) when no model is configured, so bare OpenCode panes still get Agent Mail identities.
- **First-class agent plugin readiness contract** ([#260](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/issues/260), partial): plugins can register `[agent.readiness]` idle/working/error patterns that the parser and status detector honour, plugin agent types flow through robot reports, `ntm send --<plugin>` targeting works, and deps probes call the plugin's probe command. Verified live against Oh My Pi v18; setup/preflight TOML support is tracked on the issue.

### Internal

- Removed the superseded legacy e2e scenario harness (bd-yhc8r).

---

## [v1.29.3] -- 2026-08-20 [GitHub Release]

**Migrate-hardening patch** (adversarial torture-test findings against v1.29.2's headline feature).

### Reliability

- **`ntm config migrate` verdicts are honest**: when dead keys survive the line surgery (live inline tables like `rotation = { prefer_restart = true }`, BOM-defeated headers), the command no longer reports "config is clean" — the lenient re-scan always runs, `clean` requires zero unresolved keys, the file stays untouched when nothing is removable, and each unresolved key is named for manual cleanup.
- **Backups can never clobber**: same-second migrations get `O_EXCL` collision-proof backup names. Sixteen new torture tests pin prefix-collision, dotted/quoted-key, nested-bracket-array, inline-table, CRLF, BOM, symlink, concurrent-lock, and read-only behavior, and an end-to-end test proves `ntm shell` still reflects custom `[agents]` config.

---

## [v1.29.2] -- 2026-08-20 [GitHub Release]

**Config-migration UX patch** — fixes the removed-key warning wall that greeted every new terminal pane on machines with pre-v1.26 configs (field incident, `bd-config-migrate-warning-wall-151x2`).

### Features

- **`ntm config migrate`** surgically deletes every removed/deprecated config key (both migration batches) from the selected config file — keys that by definition never had an effect, so behavior cannot change. Timestamped backup always written first; comments, ordering, and every live byte preserved; emptied tables removed; `--dry-run` and `--json` supported; clean configs no-op.

### Reliability

- The startup config warning collapses to **one line** pointing at `ntm config migrate` and `ntm doctor` (the full per-key detail remains in robot error envelopes, doctor, and `--dry-run`); `ntm shell`, `completion`, and shell-completion internals no longer load config at all and emit zero stderr — new panes stay clean.

---

## [v1.29.1] -- 2026-08-19 [GitHub Release]

**Same-day patch: the two issues filed against v1.29.0, fixed.**

### Reliability

- **Stale projections no longer hide live sessions (#254).** When every runtime-projection row passes its staleness horizon, `--robot-snapshot`/`--robot-status` now verify against live tmux and serve the live view with a staleness alert instead of returning an empty session list; an empty result is served only when live tmux confirms idle.
- **Pane identities publish before agents launch (#255).** Spawn writes each agent's Agent Mail identity (canonical + legacy files, durable registry) immediately before its launch keystrokes, so a booting agent can never race its own registration; identity failures stay fail-open (mail down never blocks a spawn).
- **Tagged test code compiles in CI again.** A new tagged-vet guard compiles the integration, e2e+ensemble, and load test variants with a firing canary and a tag census — and immediately caught three more tagged tests rotted by the dead-code sweep, now fixed.

---

## [v1.29.0] -- 2026-08-19 [GitHub Release]

**The P3-backlog and fleet-friction release**: the final open beads implemented, ~72k lines of dead code removed, the second config-deprecation batch flipped to errors as promised, and a fleet-wide cass mining pass converted three weeks of real agent friction into fixes.

### Features

- **Parallel pipeline execution.** Independent ready steps run concurrently (`settings.limits.max_parallel_steps`, default 4; `1` restores serial order) with fail_fast sibling cancellation, per-pane dispatch serialization, and race-clean state recording.
- **Real ensemble lead-agent synthesis.** Agent-based synthesis strategies dispatch the lead synthesis agent through gated delivery with fenced-response parsing; degradation to mechanical merge is recorded loudly, never silent.
- **Skill-matched spawn assignment** routes through the capability matrix with per-assignment rationale (provably different from top-n); `summary --since` genuinely filters via the archive time oracle; **durable HTTP approvals** — serve's approval endpoints share one approval space with the CLI (two-person SLB rule surfaces as 403, WS events fire after durable transitions, 503 fail-closed without a store).

### Reliability

- **tmux session targets are exact-match** (`=` sigil through one canonical helper, ~90 call sites): spawning `foo` beside `foo_bar` can no longer cross-wire panes into the sibling session — a field-mined collision class.
- **Fleet-friction batch** (from cass mining across seven machines): paste-buffer names are collision-proof across processes; `-V` joins `--version`; curated did-you-mean hints cover the fleet's most-guessed flags (`--message` aliases `--msg`); missing beads workspaces read as clean empty results instead of INTERNAL_ERROR; empty-message errors are INVALID_ARGS; invalid model IDs get advisory registry suggestions; kill-time Agent Mail cleanup releases dead pane agents' reservations.
- **Dead-code burndown complete**: the pre-existing backlog reached zero — 1,380 symbols (~72k LOC) deleted after per-symbol re-verification under both build variants, 32 justified permanent entries remain.

### Changed — BREAKING (v1.29.0)

- **The second deprecation batch of config keys now fails the loader**
  (v1.29.0 flip promised in the v1.28.0 entry; `bd-6otuk`, flip bead
  `bd-ad54k`): the 128 reader-less config keys deprecated in v1.28.0 (second
  dead-knob batch — `[accounts]`, `[scanner.*]` except `ubs_path`, the
  `[spawn_pacing]` rate/backoff/headroom subset, the `[cass]` subset,
  integrations leaves, the `[checkpoints]` subset,
  `[tmux.activity_indicators]`, `robot.output.{pretty,timestamps,compress}`,
  `rotation.prefer_restart`/`rotation.accounts.priority`, and the seven
  singles) no longer load with a deprecation warning — each one is now a hard
  strict-loader **error** with the same key + disposition text the v1.28.0
  warning carried, exactly like the v1.26.0→v1.27.0 flip. A single failed
  load lists **every** offending key present (v1.26.0-batch removed keys,
  v1.28.0-batch deprecated keys, and genuinely unknown fields together), so
  one pass over the error tells you everything to delete. `ntm config
  set`/persistence validation rejects the same keys with the same disposition
  text. `ntm doctor` still names each deprecated key present in a config file
  (now as an error check) because it scans the file leniently — useful
  precisely when the strict loader refuses to start. The project-level
  `.ntm.yaml` scanner schema is unchanged, and the `ensemble.*` keys remain
  valid (they were claimed as live in v1.28.0, not deprecated). The
  deprecation list is frozen; this release adds no new deprecations.
  **Migration:** delete the listed keys from your config file (or run
  `ntm config migrate`, which removes them surgically with a backup) — see
  the deprecated-key migration table in the v1.28.0 entry below for the full
  list and per-key dispositions. Nothing changes behaviorally — these values
  were already ignored.

### Notes

- **Corrected commit provenance.** Commit `d08893d9`'s message incorrectly
  attributed the fail-closed serve safety-policy change to its completion and
  tmux diff. The actual safety-policy implementation is `dda4aae8`; history
  is preserved and this note is the forward correction.

---

## [v1.28.0] -- 2026-08-18 [GitHub Release]

**The issue-triage release: Grok Build phase 2, the Agent Mail delivery loop closed, and every open GitHub issue resolved** (#231, #251, #252, #253), plus the post-v1.27.0 review fixes and the second staged config-deprecation batch.

### Features

- **Grok Build phase 2 (#251).** Grok panes graduate from spawn-only to full swarm citizenship: readiness/working/composer patterns observed from the real authenticated TUI (permanent `│ ❯ │` composer chrome, braille spinner phase verbs, `Worked for Ns` turn ends), composer-gated `send`/`--robot-send` with per-submission verification and one-Enter rescue, plain-Ctrl+C interrupt, restart/relaunch honoring `--model`/`--effort` overrides, assignment, wait-until-ready, and health grading — every surface live-verified through ntm against the real TUI (~45 refusal tests across 16 packages became acceptance tests). Persona injection alone stays refused: the grok CLI has no system-prompt mechanism.
- **Coordinator mail nudge (#231).** A default-off coordinator checker (`[coordinator] mail_nudge`, `nudge_cooldown_seconds`, `nudge_message`) closes the Agent Mail delivery loop: idle panes with unread mail get a composer-verified "check your inbox" nudge through the gated dispatch path — never into a working pane, fail-closed for undetectable agent types, per-pane cooldown watermarks, every decision on the attention feed, proven by a fakeagent E2E.
- **Configurable bv timeout (#253).** `[integrations.bv] timeout_seconds` (default 30) and `NTM_BV_TIMEOUT` govern every bv subprocess; caller-set `BV_*` env vars provably reach the child, so `BV_NO_CACHE=1 BV_ROBOT_HISTORY_TIMEOUT_MS=2000` wrappers are no longer needed.

### Reliability

- **Linked worktrees are one project (#252).** Session project identity resolves through `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, so a base checkout plus its `--worktrees` panes group as one repository (the base checkout wins as canonical root) while genuinely distinct repositories are still refused.
- **Post-v1.27.0 review fixes now released:** routing filter keys canonicalize agent-type aliases; the JSON/robot session-kill path clears routing state; the workflow review gate counts only the gating role's approvals; kqueue stat-fallback baselines survive snapshot races; `ntm conflicts --json`/`changes --json` emit `[]` instead of `null`; `FindGitRoot` carries a bounded TTL cache; `swarm.force_global_auth_clobber` config wiring actually reads the config; nine dangling references from the dead-code sweep corrected (including a secret-scanning ignore that had silently unshielded live redaction fixtures).

### Deprecated — config keys (second dead-knob batch, bd-6otuk)

- **128 reader-less config keys deprecated, WS6-style staged removal** (G2
  config-key liveness audit, `bd-6otuk`): each key below is now parsed by
  nothing — setting it still loads, but emits one loud startup **warning**
  per key naming the key and its disposition, and the value is **ignored**.
  In v1.29.0 these keys become hard strict-loader **errors** with the same
  disposition text, exactly like the v1.26.0→v1.27.0 flip. `ntm doctor`
  lists every deprecated key present in the config file (warning check);
  `ntm config set` persistence tolerates them for this release.

  Deprecated-key migration table (v1.28.0 → error in v1.29.0):

  | Key family | Keys | Disposition |
  |---|---|---|
  | `[accounts]` (whole section) | `state_file`, `auto_rotate`, `reset_buffer_minutes`, `[[accounts.<provider>]]` `email`/`alias`/`priority` for claude, codex, gemini, antigravity, cursor, windsurf, aider, ollama (27) | never had an effect — account rotation reads `[rotation]` and caam, not `[accounts]` |
  | `[scanner.*]` except `ubs_path` | all of `[scanner.defaults]`, `[scanner.thresholds.{pre_commit,ci,dashboard,interactive}]`, `[scanner.tools]`, `[scanner.beads]`, `[scanner.notifications]` (37) | never had an effect — only `scanner.ubs_path` is read; the auto-scan chain never shipped. The project-level `.ntm.yaml` scanner schema is unchanged |
  | `[spawn_pacing]` rate/backoff/headroom | `max_spawns_per_sec`, `burst_size`, `default_retries`, `retry_delay_ms`, `backpressure_threshold`, `agent_caps.*_rate_per_sec`, `agent_caps.*_ramp_up_delay_ms`, `agent_caps.cooldown_on_failure_ms`, `agent_caps.recovery_successes`, all `[spawn_pacing.backoff]`, all `[spawn_pacing.headroom]` (24) | never had an effect — live pacing knobs: `enabled`, `max_concurrent_spawns`, `agent_caps.{claude,codex,gemini}_max_concurrent` |
  | `[cass]` subset | `show_install_hints`, all `[cass.duplicates]`, `[cass.search]`, `[cass.tui]` (10) | never had an effect — duplicate checking is driven by CLI flags; `[cass]` core + `[cass.context]` stay live |
  | integrations leaves | `caam.{enabled,auto_rotate,providers}`, `rano.{binary_path,providers}`, `process_triage.binary_path`, `rch.{min_build_time,show_location,preferred_worker,dcg_whitelist,fallback_local}` (11) | never had an effect — adapters resolve binaries from PATH; `rch.dcg_whitelist` was a documented legacy no-op |
  | `[checkpoints]` subset | `auto_checkpoint_on_spawn`, `interval_minutes`, `on_rotation`, `on_error` (4) | never had an effect — the background checkpoint worker never shipped; the other `[checkpoints]` knobs and manual `ntm checkpoint` are unaffected |
  | `[tmux.activity_indicators]` | `enabled`, `active_seconds`, `stalled_seconds` (3) | never had an effect |
  | `[robot.output]` subset | `pretty`, `timestamps`, `compress` (3) | never had an effect — `robot.output.format` remains live |
  | rotation subset | `rotation.prefer_restart`, `rotation.accounts.priority` (2) | never had an effect — rotation accounts are used in the order written |
  | singles | `agent_mail.program_name`, `agents.default_count`, `recovery.stale_threshold_hours`, `resilience.rate_limit.patterns`, `suggestions_enabled`, `preflight.enabled`, `command_hooks.description` (7) | never had an effect — the agent-mail program name is fixed to `ntm`; rate-limit patterns are built into `internal/agent`; `preflight.strict` and `command_hooks.name` remain live |

  **Migration:** delete the listed keys from `~/.config/ntm/config.toml`
  (the startup warning names each one), or run `ntm config migrate` to
  remove them surgically with a backup. Nothing changes behaviorally — these
  values were already ignored.

- **Excluded from deprecation — `ensemble.*` (24 keys stay valid)**: the
  audit's premise ("reader compiled out of shipped binaries") was only half
  true. Eight ensemble defaults (`default_ensemble`, `agent_mix`,
  `assignment`, `allow_advanced`, `mode_tier_default`, `budget.total`,
  `budget.per_agent`, `cache.enabled`) are read in EVERY build by the
  `--robot-ensemble-spawn` config-default path and are now claimed as live;
  the remaining 16 (`synthesis.*`, `cache.*`, `budget.{synthesis,context_pack}`,
  `early_stop.*`) drive real spawns under `-tags ensemble_experimental` and
  are claimed under that tag, with permanent build-tag-blind-spot allowlist
  entries on the untagged side.

### Fixed

- **`swarm.force_global_auth_clobber` now works** (`bd-6otuk`): the config
  value was overwritten by the `--force-global-auth-clobber` flag's
  hard-coded `false` default before any read, making the knob a silent
  no-op. The config value now seeds the flag default (mirroring
  `--auto-rotate-accounts`); an explicit flag still overrides.

- **Corrected commit provenance.** Commit `d08893d9`'s message incorrectly
  attributed the fail-closed serve safety-policy change to its completion and
  tmux diff. The actual safety-policy implementation is `dda4aae8`; history
  is preserved and this note is the forward correction.

### Reliability

- **Post-v1.27.0 follow-up fixes.** Routing state for killed sessions is
  dropped and filter keys are canonicalized before lookup
  ([c28737ee](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/c28737ee));
  workflow review gates count approvals per role and keep fresh kqueue
  baselines after missed-write stat fallbacks
  ([49ff8087](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/49ff8087));
  the guard scripts take the first bead id from `br list` output instead of
  the last token
  ([1b1259f4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/1b1259f4));
  and the REST beads isolation test proves isolation with a marker title
  rather than a row count
  ([2979458b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/2979458b)).

## [v1.27.0] -- 2026-08-18 [GitHub Release]

**The bug-fix and backlog-burndown release.** Every open defect bead from the
reality-bridge review gates is fixed, the pre-existing E2E debt is retired, and
the staged config removal completes its second phase.

### Changed — BREAKING

- **Previously-deprecated config keys now fail the loader** (WS6-remove-finalize,
  `bd-ws6-config-truth-ienmd.3`): the config keys removed in v1.26.0
  (WS6-remove, `bd-ws6-config-truth-ienmd.2`) no longer load with a
  deprecation warning — each one is now a hard strict-loader **error** with
  the same key + disposition text the v1.26.0 warning carried. A single
  failed load lists **every** removed key present (plus any genuinely unknown
  fields), so one pass over the error tells you everything to delete.
  `ntm config set`/persistence validation rejects the same keys with the same
  disposition text. `ntm doctor` still names each removed key present in a
  config file (now as an error check) because it scans the file leniently —
  useful precisely when the strict loader refuses to start. The removal list
  is frozen; this release adds no new removals. **Migration:** delete the
  listed keys from your config file (or run `ntm config migrate`, which
  removes them surgically with a backup) — see the removed-key migration
  table in the v1.26.0 entry below for the full list and per-key
  dispositions.

### Reliability

- **Review-gate follow-ups, all closed.** cm refuses port-fallback duplicate daemons; the guard degraded-ledger splits unreachable-vs-error reasons, self-prunes, and doctor checks that `ntm` is on the hook's PATH; the MCP health probe rejects port squatters; conflict negotiation publishes honest `conflict_release_requested` outcomes with cooldown-after-success and deep-copied holder state; deadlock wording is honestly advisory; workflow runner state is race-clean with serialized dispatch, review gates cover every role/target shape, kqueue-missed file writes fire via a stat fallback, and tilde paths resolve.
- **Routing hardened end-to-end.** Rotation state is keyed by `(session, filter)` with pane-anchored cursors that skip nothing when panes vanish; advisory routes take no write locks; stale rows purge; affinity resolves session-first project keys through a process-shared TTL cache; the coordinator's auto-assign selects by multi-factor score instead of first-fit (the redundant strategy layer is deleted).
- **Truth in envelopes and jobs.** Job stores are bounded with deterministic listings; nested list-shaped schema types are flagged (28 caught); arrays-never-null covers by-value payloads and compact capabilities; assignment skip reasons are honest; mixed-target CASS injection uses neutral formatting and records config-disabled skips.
- **Platform and test integrity.** Darwin liveness answers from one sysctl call (eliminating 42 subprocess spawns per status invocation); the integration test package fails loudly in CI instead of silently no-opping, and REST beads tests are provably isolated from the repository's own beads DB; `@vscode/vsce` is vendored so vsix builds fetch nothing at release time; the canonical-pane/replay/spawn E2E clusters pass against the hardened delivery gates via a new fakeshell fixture (14 tests un-stuck, all siblings green).

### Verification And Release

- The G1 dead-code backlog burned 607 allowlist lines (six orphan packages, eight dead files, sixteen partial strips — ~24k LOC); all 408 live config keys carry liveness claims with 153 reader-less knobs re-tagged for their own staged removal; all 12 waived designer docs are rewritten to shipped shapes and every legacy stub-marker comment is resolved; the audit ledger sampler is era-scoped.

---

## [v1.26.0] -- 2026-08-18 [GitHub Release]

**R3 of the reality-bridge program: the deletion & config-truth release.** Wave
W4 removed ~13,700 lines of dead sophistication under the operator's recorded
sign-off ([77744bfe](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/77744bfe)),
moved every reader-less config knob into staged removal with a one-release
migration runway, and closed the program's allowlist register down to
backlog + permanent composition only (zero registered-item lines) — verified by
an independent W4 review gate with spot-revert proof-of-proof and the scripted
v1.26.0 reality re-audit (10/10 spot-probes WORKS against a release-style
binary; `docs/reality/audit-v1.26.0.md`).

### Removed (W4 deletion batch, operator-approved 2026-08-17)

- **Dead auto-respawner deleted** (C5, `bd-ws2-wire-or-delete-ykmcz.5`): the
  never-wired 1,227-line `internal/swarm/auto_respawner.go` and its dead-only
  tests are gone; the shipped resilience/respawn path is unaffected. The live
  graceful-exit key-sequence helpers it hosted moved to
  `internal/swarm/graceful_exit.go`. Git history is the attic.
- **Four redundant dashboard panels deleted** (C6-delete,
  `bd-ws2-wire-or-delete-ykmcz.7`): the never-instantiated compare, context,
  effectiveness, and ensemble panels duplicated `ntm compare`, the context
  CLI, and the ensemble subcommands. The wired quota, ratelimit, and accounts
  panels (and the history panel) stay.
- **Pressure governor `Gate()` and the bottleneck profiler deleted** (C8,
  `bd-ws2-wire-or-delete-ykmcz.9`): zero callers, and the vnext verification
  matrix's cited `BenchmarkGate` evidence never existed. The live pressure
  snapshot/admission path (`New`/`Refresh`/`Latest`/`RobotSnapshot`,
  `EvaluateSpawnAdmission`) and the live profiler spans/recommendations
  surface (`ntm --profile`) are untouched;
  `internal/profiler/{bottleneck,backpressure}.go` and the unreachable
  profiler report/timing helpers are gone.
- **Nine orphaned packages, the caut coordinator, and the rch build-storm
  advisory deleted** (C9, `bd-ws2-wire-or-delete-ykmcz.10`):
  `internal/{contentionforecast,dispatchplan,doctor,driftaudit,evidencebudget,fairness,faultharness,identityhygiene,parity}`
  had no importers outside their own tests; the caut→CAAM coordinator and the
  rch build-storm advisory cascaded with them. Repo-wide reference sweep at
  the W4 gate found zero live references to any deleted surface; the
  survivors it verified by test (resilience monitor, quota/ratelimit/accounts
  panels, `pressure` governor snapshot path, caut `CachedClient`,
  `kernel.Run`) all stay.
- **The kernel-registry OpenAPI generator and its TypeScript predecessor
  deleted** (WS4-resolution, `bd-ws4-openapi-parity-wpwck`):
  `docs/openapi-kernel.json` (a 13-path hand-mirror of a 263-handler router)
  and `scripts/gen_openapi.ts` are gone. The served chi router is the single
  source of truth — `ntm openapi generate` walks it hermetically, and the
  `openapi-drift` CI job regenerates and diff-gates `docs/openapi.json` +
  `docs/parity_matrix.json` on every build.
- **Reader-less config knobs removed — staged, with a one-release migration
  runway** (WS6-remove, `bd-ws6-config-truth-ienmd.2`): every config key that
  was parsed, validated, and printed but read by nothing is removed. In
  v1.26.0 a config that still sets one of these keys **loads normally** and
  the loader emits a loud per-key deprecation warning naming the key and its
  disposition; `ntm doctor` lists the same warnings. In v1.27.0 the warnings
  become strict-loader errors with identical text
  (`bd-ws6-config-truth-ienmd.3`). One knob escalated to KEEP instead:
  `integrations.xf.enabled` has a live reader (it gates the built-in
  `xf-search` palette entry) and now carries a G2 liveness claim plus a
  behavior test.

  Migration table (all removed keys; disposition: removed, no replacement —
  the key never had an effect):

  | Removed key(s) | Notes |
  |---|---|
  | `tmux.palette_key` | dead knob (H3 decision) |
  | `integrations.caam.rate_limit_patterns`, `.account_cooldown`, `.alert_threshold` | built-in behavior unchanged |
  | `[integrations.caut].*` (whole section) | cascades from the C9 caut coordinator deletion |
  | `[integrations.proxy].*` (whole section) | rust_proxy integration had no reader |
  | `integrations.process_triage.on_stuck` | no stuck-action machinery ships |
  | `integrations.rano.persist_history`, `.history_days` | no history persistence ships |
  | `integrations.xf.bin_path`, `.archive_path`, `.default_mode` | xf resolves from PATH; use `--xf-mode` per invocation (`integrations.xf.enabled` KEPT) |
  | `[rotation.dashboard].*` (whole section) | dashboard panels never read it |
  | `[swarm.limit_patterns]`, `[swarm.marching_orders]` | never read by the swarm engine |
  | `[retry.scheduler]`, `[retry.completion]`, `[retry.db]`, `[retry.assign]` | no such retry loops ship; live overrides are `[retry.webhook]`, `[retry.alerts]`, `[retry.agent_mail]` |
  | `memory.include_anti_patterns`, `memory.include_history` | no substrate |

  Genuinely unknown keys remain hard load errors, exactly as before.
  (Since v1.29.2: delete the keys by hand or run
  `ntm config migrate`, which removes them surgically with a backup.)

### Infrastructure

- **The allowlist register reached its end-state composition:** zero
  registered-item lines remain; every surviving line is backlog-tagged
  (`config` 408, `deadcode` 2058 + 49 C4 residue, `docs` 12, `placebo` 25)
  or `# permanent:` (2 deadcode test hooks), with `contracts` at 0 —
  enforced by `check_allowlists.sh`'s closed-bead and both-direction
  ratchet checks.
- **Reality re-audit v1.26.0 committed** (`docs/reality/audit-v1.26.0.md`):
  10/10 seeded spot-probes WORKS against the release-style binary; the one
  guard failure it caught (a selftest fixture pinning a bead that has since
  closed) was root-caused and fixed in
  `scripts/guards/allowlist_selftest.sh`, which now discovers a live open
  bead instead of pinning one.

---

## [v1.25.0] -- 2026-08-17 [GitHub Release]

**R2 of the reality-bridge program: the wiring release.** Waves W2+W3 wired every
"engine built, never reachable" capability to a real user surface, shipped the
never-released deliverables, and made the docs tell the truth — verified by
independent review gates with proof-of-proof spot-reverts and the first scripted
reality re-audit (10/10 probes against a release-style binary).

### Features

- **The web UI ships.** All 12 dashboard routes (including new memory and rebuilt agents pages) export statically, ride the binary via go:embed (+1.2 MB), and serve from `ntm web` / `ntm serve --web` with version lockstep and a weekly dependency-audit CI job.
- **The VSCode extension ships.** Compiles in CI, packages as a release `.vsix` (pinned toolchain), documented install-from-vsix.
- **Ensemble spawn ships.** The `ensemble_experimental` tag rides release builds after its fakeagent E2E bar went green live (mode-disjoint dispatch proven from fixture event logs).
- **`ntm workflow run`** executes the previously-unreachable RuntimeCoordinator against live panes through gated dispatch — all four builtins plus user TOMLs, live-proven (red-green handoff transcript-asserted).
- **`--with-cass` / `--no-cass`** wire send-time CASS context injection on both send surfaces, redacted and framed data-not-instructions, with a degraded skip path.
- **Coordinator conflict negotiation** runs behind the persisted flag with published outcomes; **deadlock detection** is reachable via `locks --check-deadlocks`, the robot envelope, and the digest; **reservation-affinity scoring** populates from live Agent Mail data; **`--dist-strategy`** routes through real planners with propagated confidence; the **quota, ratelimit, and accounts panels** joined the dashboard.
- **`ntm guards install`** writes a hook that actually checks staged files against reservations (visible fail-open, strict opt-in); **`ntm memory serve`** really supervises cm with an MCP-aware health probe.

### Reliability

- **Contract breadth is now enforced, not asserted:** arrays-never-null is an encoder invariant with a registry-walk test; pagination covers five formerly-unbounded surfaces with exact machine-checkable scope; Idempotency-Key covers all 73 mutating routes with single-flight and a bounded LRU; the jobs API dispatches three real operations (cancel actually cancels) and returns honest NOT_IMPLEMENTED elsewhere.
- **OpenAPI and the parity matrix are generated from the served router** (158 paths/178 ops, deterministic, drift-gated in CI), replacing a stale hand-curated spec.
- **Config knobs govern real behavior:** `[retry]` drives three retry loops, rotation thresholds bind, `[recovery]` aliases with deprecation warnings; token-efficiency claims are measured (markdown ~84%, TOON ~39%) with pinned floors.
- **UX truth:** NDJSON under `--json` for watch surfaces; `chars_sent` equals delivered bytes; per-pane best-effort interrupt with `PARTIAL_INTERRUPT` envelopes; personas wired for gmi/agy with loud grok refusal; palette help generated from the keymap (dead keys gone, q-quits-while-typing fixed); installer checks tmux and PATH loudly; approve history returns every decision state; user panes titled with visible border-status; shell completion covers all 114 commands from the cobra tree.
- **Docs truth:** every ORCHESTRATION example is real (skip-budget burned to zero), planned-but-shipped claims corrected under grep-gates, the vnext verification matrix cites only gates that exist.

- **Arrays-never-null is now an encoder invariant, not a constructor
  convention.** (bd-ws3-contract-breadth-psvyu.2) Every robot envelope —
  success and failure terminals alike — is normalized through
  `EnsureArraysNeverNull` before encoding, so slice fields marshal as `[]`
  (or are omitted via `omitempty`), never as JSON `null`. A registry-walk
  conformance test (`TestArraysNeverNullRegistryWalk`) zero-instantiates
  every registered schema type and fails on any null-where-array, with an
  empty exception list; new envelope types are covered at registration time.
- **Pagination scope is exact, exhaustive, and machine-checkable; five
  unbounded list surfaces gained real offset/limit paging.**
  (bd-ws3-contract-breadth-psvyu.1)
  - `ntm list`, `ntm history`, `ntm audit show/search`,
    `ntm checkpoint list`, and `ntm approve list` accept `--limit/--offset`
    and return `count`/`total_matches`/`has_more` plus
    `_agent_hints.next_offset` in JSON mode (`ntm history` offsets count
    back from the newest entry so the default stays "last N").
  - The WS0-G6 single-declaration flag map
    (`internal/robot/schema_pagination.go`) marks EVERY list-shaped schema
    type `paginated: true/false` with a recorded reason; an unflagged list
    type fails the registry-walk conformance test, and
    `--robot-capabilities` exposes `paginated`/`paginated_reason` per
    surface (plus a `pagination_contract_violations` self-check, empty on
    healthy builds).
  - Registry metadata that over-claimed offset pagination
    (`attention`, `events`, `beads-list` Boundedness) was corrected to
    cursor/limit truncation honesty, and
    `docs/robot-ordering-pagination.md` now scopes the pagination claim to
    the exact flagged surface table instead of implying list-wide support.
- **Assignment strategies are real now: `--dist-strategy` / `--strategy`
  route through the graph-aware planner.** (bd-ws2-wire-or-delete-ykmcz.4)
  - Previously `--dist-strategy` (send `--distribute`) and `--strategy`
    (`--robot-assign`) were cosmetic: beads were paired with idle agents
    sequentially regardless of strategy, and only the printed reasoning
    changed — the output claimed strategy behavior that never ran.
  - `balanced`, `speed`, `quality`, and `dependency` now run the real
    planner in `internal/assign`: pairings are scored against the agent
    capability matrix, and `dependency` consumes the bead graph's
    unblocks fan-out (blockers that unblock more work are assigned first).
    Each strategy produces genuinely different assignments (proof:
    `TestPlanAssignments_*` in `internal/robot`).
  - Planner confidence is propagated instead of discarded: `--robot-assign`
    recommendations carry the planner's confidence, and the distribute
    envelope's recommendation objects gain a `confidence` field.
  - **Behavior/name change for defaults:** the historical sequential
    pairing keeps running under its honest name `simple`, which is the new
    default for both flags (previously the default was *named* `balanced`
    while *behaving* sequentially). Users who never pass the flag get
    byte-identical pairing behavior, but envelopes now report
    `"strategy": "simple"`, and the simple reasoning string honestly says
    "simple sequential pairing" instead of claiming a strategy.
    Explicitly passing `balanced`/`speed`/`quality`/`dependency` now
    changes real assignment output. Defaults are pinned by
    `TestAssignStrategyDefaultPinnedToSimple` and
    `Test*StrategyFlagDefaultPinnedToSimple`.

- **Config truth (WS6-wire): `[retry]`, `rotation.thresholds`, and the
  `memory.*`/`[recovery]` shadowing are now real.**
  (bd-ws6-config-truth-ienmd.1)
  - `[retry]` gains its first real readers. `config.RetryPolicyFor` now
    governs three shipping retry loops: webhook event delivery
    (`[retry.webhook]` + the global backoff shape knobs `max_delay_ms`,
    `backoff_factor`, `jitter`), robot alert webhook delivery
    (`[retry.alerts]`, inheriting globals), and Agent Mail MCP busy retries
    (new `[retry.agent_mail]` override; defaults 3 retries / 500ms preserve
    the historical hardcoded loop). Defaults are behavior-identical to the
    previous hardcoded values; `retry.jitter` now defaults to `false`
    because no shipped loop ever jittered while the section was dead —
    jitter is strictly opt-in.
  - `rotation.thresholds.*` now governs the rotation engine.
    `warning_percent`/`critical_percent` classify quota readings in
    `ntm rotate all-limited` (a pane at or above `critical_percent` is now
    selected for rotation even before the provider hard-limits it;
    `warning_percent` readings are surfaced without rotating).
    `restart_if_tokens_above`/`restart_if_session_hours` add restart
    triggers to the coordinator's context-rotation check (active only when
    `rotation.usage_percent_threshold` > 0 enables that checker).
  - `[recovery]` is now the single session-recovery section. The
    overlapping deprecated `memory.*` keys (`include_in_recovery`,
    `max_rules`, `query_timeout_seconds`, and the recovery side of
    `enabled`) are aliased into their `[recovery]` counterparts for this
    release with a loud per-key deprecation warning; the aliases are
    removed in v1.27.0. Explicit `[recovery]` keys always win. The
    send-scoped `memory.send_*` keys are unaffected and stay in `[memory]`.

- **`ntm metrics snapshot list` now really lists saved snapshots.** The
  command previously returned an empty result unconditionally while
  `snapshot save` and `compare` genuinely persisted to the
  `metric_snapshots` table, telling users their saved snapshots did not
  exist. The missing List query is now implemented
  (`Collector.ListSnapshots`): snapshots are returned oldest-first, scoped
  to the session, and the `--json` envelope's `snapshots` array is always
  present (empty array, never null). Proof tests:
  `TestMetricsSnapshotList_SaveTwoThenListJSON`,
  `TestMetricsSnapshotList_EmptyDBJSON`,
  `TestCollectorWithStore_ListSnapshots` (bd-ws1-truth-safety-l5ddi.3).

- **Corrected commit provenance.** Commit `d08893d9`'s message incorrectly
  attributed the fail-closed serve safety-policy change to its completion and
  tmux diff. The actual safety-policy implementation is `dda4aae8`; history
  is preserved and this note is the forward correction.

---

## [v1.24.4] -- 2026-08-16 [GitHub Release]

**R1 of the reality-bridge program** -- a project-wide reality check (code vs documented promises) produced systemic CI guards and this first truth-and-bugs wave.

### Reliability

- **Placebo surfaces made real.** `ntm metrics snapshot list` runs an actual session-scoped query instead of unconditionally returning an empty list; `work queue-dry --create-beads` resolves the roadmap parent from the *target* project (flag, then a single open epic, never a hardcoded foreign epic) and reports `dry_run` truthfully from what actually happened.
- **Live bugs fixed.** Worktree merge/sync detect the repository's default branch instead of assuming `main`; a failed quota fetch reads UNKNOWN instead of healthy; `--robot-dcg-status` reports the real `[integrations.dcg]` config and counts actual check cycles; session labels split on the canonical `--` helper (three copy-paste extractors unified); robot-mode spawns now start the same resilience monitor CLI spawns get, with envelope-visible best-effort semantics; `random` routing is genuinely random and sticky/round-robin persist per-session state (migration 019).
- **Review-gate catches.** Monitor manifests record live `%N` pane IDs (the physical-address form would have read every robot-spawned agent as crashed); dry-run routing no longer advances persisted cursors.

### Verification And Release

- **Seven systemic CI guards** now make the audited gap classes unrepresentable: a dead-code gate (deadcode over `cmd/ntm`, multi-GOOS), a config-key liveness test, a docs-example conformance test (which found 80 broken examples on its first run), a release-artifact lockstep preflight, a placebo lint, single-definition contract lints, and both-direction allowlist ratchets with mandatory firing canaries. The hermetic serve parity harness runs in CI with an executed-count>0 assertion -- which immediately exposed that the integration test package had silently never run in CI (bd-zaarm).
- The One Reachable Implementation rule is now an ADR in AGENTS.md; a scripted 90-minute re-audit ritual (`scripts/reality_audit.sh`) becomes the release gate.

---

## [v1.24.3] -- 2026-08-16 [GitHub Release]

**6 commits since v1.24.2** -- a fourth fresh-eyes pass: the released contract smoke-verified live, the E2E backlog triaged to root cause, and two small shipped defects corrected.

### Reliability

- **Solo operators are no longer stranded by the force-release gate.** The approval-required refusal now explains that self-approval is rejected for SLB requests and names the escape hatch (`ntm policy automation --force-release auto`); the approval workflow is documented where force-release appears in the README and operator references ([5a8ddc6b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/5a8ddc6b)).
- **CAAM operand validation scans the raw name.** The control-byte check ran over the trimmed string while the raw string reached the caam argv, so whitespace-wrapped control bytes passed; both call sites now agree and scan the raw operand ([3dfcfcda](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/3dfcfcda)).

### Verification And Release

- Smoke-verified the released v1.24.2 binary live against its own source contract -- config surfaces, refusal envelopes, approval flow, capabilities/schema, idempotent preflight replay, disk metrics -- with zero deviations found ([d5e8a524](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d5e8a524)).
- Triaged the full E2E backlog to root cause: the atomic-assignment cluster was the composer-visibility gate's intentional fail-closed hardening outpacing the test harness (panes now primed with real composer glyphs), and the grep/doctor/dedupe/ensemble clusters were pre-session test drift -- 62/66 of the affected tests now pass, with the remaining pre-session fixture work tracked in bd-h4t0j ([73e30fe6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/73e30fe6), [173ece8f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/173ece8f), [d5e8a524](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d5e8a524)).

---

## [v1.24.2] -- 2026-08-16 [GitHub Release]

**8 commits since v1.24.1** -- a third fresh-eyes pass: race-detector-clean, security-hardened, Windows-correct.

### Reliability

- **Windows: process liveness detection actually works.** The POSIX signal-0 probe silently reports every process dead on Windows (Go's `os.Process` implements only `Kill` there), which made v1.24's CM daemon discovery skip live daemons and serve's memory-daemon health check judge running daemons stopped; liveness now uses a native check on Windows ([b45681bc](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/b45681bc)).
- **Security hardening across the new surfaces.** Scanner-derived finding text is sanitized (control bytes stripped, whitespace collapsed, per-field length caps) and explicitly attributed as data-not-instructions before any pane nudge; the bugs digest and attention-item paths now pass through the same redaction as dispatch; CM rule content is scrubbed of non-printable runes before send; caam account operands are validated against flag-shaped names; the serve force-release 403 no longer leaks policy file paths or content into HTTP bodies; and `ntm approve --help` now states plainly that approver identity is asserted, not authenticated ([bc8dceae](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/bc8dceae), [2ce89523](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/2ce89523), [8b4ccc79](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/8b4ccc79), [eb05b264](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/eb05b264)).
- **Portable fakeagent fixture.** The E2E fixture's SIGWINCH handling moved behind build tags so `GOOS=windows go build ./...` is clean ([3e914cd3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/3e914cd3)).

### Verification And Release

- Ran the race detector across the approval, state, robot, coordinator, cli, and serve packages -- zero data races; a cold-read sweep of the full v1.23.0..HEAD production diff confirmed the remaining suspicious patterns benign, and stale doc comments orphaned by the wave's refactors were removed ([54fc1575](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/54fc1575)).

---

## [v1.24.1] -- 2026-08-15 [GitHub Release]

**3 commits since v1.24.0** -- a same-day second fresh-eyes pass over the v1.24.0 wave.

### Reliability

- **Security: approval decisions can no longer race each other.** Pending approvals now transition to approved, denied, or expired through a status-guarded SQL update, so a concurrent `ntm approve` in another process can never overwrite a landed denial (or a lazy expiry clobber a landed decision) -- closing the last blind write in the machinery hardened for v1.24.0's force-release gate ([6db712e9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/6db712e9)).
- **Cross-version idempotent replay restored.** The send-operation binding hash writes the new with-memory toggle only when set, so byte-identical retries of operations recorded by v1.23.0 replay their recorded outcome instead of failing with a spurious `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`; the pre-1.24 hash formula is pinned field-for-field by a regression test ([6db712e9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/6db712e9)).
- **Refusals are visible.** The dashboard conflict force action's policy refusal raises an on-screen toast instead of vanishing into a log file; `ntm bugs watch --json` emits a `PERMISSION_DENIED` envelope with a remediation hint; and `ntm config show --json` gains the `memory`, `bugs`, and `rotation` sections plus the CAAM failover and disk-horizon keys ([6db712e9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/6db712e9)).

### Verification And Release

- Reverified all eight fakeagent E2E suites green at HEAD after the hardening wave (48 pre-existing failures elsewhere in the tagged suite were triaged as predating v1.24.0 and tracked separately); corrected three stale commit counts and one release label in the changelog backfill, and documented `--with-memory` in the AGENTS.md robot-send modifier table ([6db712e9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/6db712e9)).

## [v1.24.0] -- 2026-08-15 [GitHub Release]

**22 commits since v1.23.0** -- a controllable fakeagent E2E persona with six live real-tmux verification suites, coordinator-driven context rotation and CAAM auto-failover (both default-off), durable WebSocket replay, disk-usage trajectory metrics, CM memory injection, reservation-routed bug nudges, and a policy-gated force-release approval fix.

### Features

- **Fakeagent E2E fixture.** A controllable Go agent-TUI persona binary runs as a real non-shell pane process and satisfies NTM's detector contracts -- bottom-pinned composer markers, bracketed-paste semantics, working chrome, interactive gate screens, rate-limit banners, strand-N submit swallowing, and a JSONL ground-truth event log -- with live acceptance proving a robot-send delivers, verifies, and rescues a stranded composer against the actual binary in real tmux ([01402394](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/01402394)).
- **Six new real-tmux E2E suites.** Live fakeagent proofs for idempotent send (claim, replay, conflict, takeover, receipt; #245), composer delivery (readiness refusal sends zero keystrokes; stranded-composer rescue), gates/restart (gated panes left untouched; `SHELL_NOT_RETURNED`), transcript context (hermetic-HOME Claude/Codex transcripts through `--robot-context`), send tracking/ack (echo-detected vs timeout), and live context rotation (threshold trigger with evidence, all four safety gates, a real pane replacement with handoff submit proof) ([6612c54a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/6612c54a), [de68c6b1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/de68c6b1), [73a91f6b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/73a91f6b)).
- **Coordinator context rotation on transcript usage.** `[rotation] usage_percent_threshold` (default 0 = off) enqueues a rotation when a pane's transcript-sourced usage -- never scrollback estimates -- crosses the threshold, through the same store `ntm rotate context pending/confirm` reads; safety gates (not working, not rate-limited, no interactive gate, no unsubmitted composer input) re-check a fresh pane capture at fire time, every skip is logged and published to the attention feed, and read-only coordinator surfaces force the threshold to 0 ([0827a84f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/0827a84f)).
- **Durable WebSocket replay.** WSEventStore persists sequence cursors on every event frame: cursor-based reconnect replays the gap exactly once then goes live, expired cursors get `stream.reset`, slow-client drops are recorded, retention pruning actually runs, and an O(n^2) ring-buffer walk is fixed -- proven by a full-server integration test ([de68c6b1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/de68c6b1)).
- **Disk-usage trajectory metrics.** `--robot-metrics`/`--robot-snapshot` carry a disk section (mount_used_pct, available_bytes, delta_bytes_per_min, projected_full_at) from cross-invocation watermark samples; optional `--disk-attribution` walks well-known build dirs under each pane's live cwd (bounded, no env persistence), and a disk_trajectory alert fires on `[alerts] disk_full_horizon_hours` ([de68c6b1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/de68c6b1)).
- **Build-slot orphan diagnosis.** Build-slot leases are reconciled against Agent Mail's archive; diagnose surfaces orphaned leases and `--fix` releases them using the registered holder tokens, worktree-mode transitions release orphans best-effort, and everything degrades gracefully when Agent Mail is away ([de68c6b1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/de68c6b1)).
- **CAAM auto-failover (default-off).** `[integrations.caam] auto_failover` switches accounts on banner-verified rate limits whose reset is past the horizon, only after a verified alternate CAAM account with headroom is found -- allow-listed providers, a one-hour per-pane cooldown, never interrupting a working pane -- and hardened to pass the same guardAutoRotation gates as every other automatic rotation (account pins honored, Codex global-auth clobber refused without safe-restore) ([3cfefd93](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/3cfefd93), [177f33fc](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/177f33fc)).
- **CM memory injection on robot sends.** `--robot-send --with-memory` (or `[memory] send_injection=true`) queries cm (MCP, then CLI fallback) and prepends the top-N rules inside `send_budget_tokens` as a compact project-rules block; memory is enrichment, never a gate -- a missing, wedged, or empty cm records a skip on the envelope and still sends -- with injected-rule outcome feedback reported automatically and a real-tmux test proving the block reaches the delivered pane payload ([d893cf91](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d893cf91), [177f33fc](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/177f33fc)).
- **`ntm bugs watch`.** Periodically reruns the same UBS invocation as `ntm bugs list`, fingerprints findings, and routes each new one to the agent holding the affected file's Agent Mail reservation through the gated dispatch service (composer-ready, submission-verified, rate-limited per pane, never interrupting a working pane); unreserved paths go out as a single digest-style broadcast, and `[bugs] push_routing` is opt-in ([243330b3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/243330b3)).

### Reliability

- **Security: force-release approval machinery hardened (P1).** The approved -> consumed transition of a durable one-shot SLB approval is now atomic in SQL, so two racing processes can never both spend one approval; approved records expire with their validity window; the serve HTTP force-release endpoint and the dashboard conflict "force" action -- both of which previously bypassed the policy gate entirely -- are policy-gated fail-closed with blocked attempts written to the audit log; and a live two-person SLB approval E2E pins the workflow against the real binary with a hermetic HOME and state DB ([177f33fc](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/177f33fc), [38fb5e1f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/38fb5e1f)).
- Auto-restart-stuck declines blocked and rate-limited panes with typed skip reasons: a restart cannot answer an interactive gate and does not lift a rate limit, so both become typed skips carried on every exit path, and SessionHealthSummary gains a blocked counter ([5c4a1451](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/5c4a1451), [fa2f3b18](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/fa2f3b18)).
- Fixed the bugs-watch pane-staleness clock that deferred every nudge forever under a real wall clock, registered the scanner digest identity before sending, wired `[bugs]` into config show/get/diff, and stopped ID-less CM rules from leaking empty strings into injection metadata ([177f33fc](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/177f33fc)).

### Verification And Release

- Covered the GetSend durable idempotency claim branches with a real store and real tmux ([722f8c36](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/722f8c36), [7490f1a7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/7490f1a7)), pinned CAAM auto-failover TOML, GetValue, Diff, and Validate behavior ([98592275](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/98592275)), and covered bugs-watch routing, cooldown, and `[bugs]` config ([b4ae3e71](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/b4ae3e71)).
- Hardened fakeagent start-waits in the gates-restart scenarios and closed the full E2E verification epic -- fixture plus scenario suites, all green against real tmux with fixture ground-truth assertions and JSONL step logging ([cf9ed007](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/cf9ed007), [73a91f6b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/73a91f6b)).

## [v1.23.0] -- 2026-08-14 [GitHub Release]

**25 commits since v1.22.1** -- the GitHub issue-triage wave (#244-#249): durable robot-send idempotency and output sequencing, a CM MCP client rewrite, width-adaptive detection, interactive-gate health, and transcript-sourced context usage.

### Features

- **Durable send idempotency (#245).** A send_operations table claims each caller-supplied `--op-id` atomically before any keystroke is injected, bound to session, canonical targets, and a SHA-256 digest of the exact payload (payload bytes never stored); identical retries replay the recorded outcome without sending again, a reused ID with a different binding errors `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`, a race or mid-send crash reports `OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS`, and per-target admission receipts are queryable via `--robot-send-receipt` (REST `Idempotency-Key` is the same operation ID) ([ef727a7f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/ef727a7f), [d233570f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d233570f), [b3dc8346](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/b3dc8346)).
- **Durable output sequencing (#246).** A privacy-preserving output-change signal -- an opaque epoch plus a monotonic cursor that advances only when NTM detects a real output change for a pane (content hashed, raw bytes never stored) -- attached to activity and status reads ([ef727a7f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/ef727a7f)).
- **Transcript-sourced context usage.** Context reporting reads the agent's own session transcripts (Claude usage records; Codex token_count events with model_context_window) via bounded 256KB tail reads and pane-cwd correlation, reports models verbatim, walks Codex sessions newest-first skipping subagents, attributes transcripts only when a cwd is unambiguous, and keeps scrollback estimation as a clearly marked fallback ([edcc7d43](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/edcc7d43), [2a8488fe](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/2a8488fe), [88bc623d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/88bc623d)).
- **Width-adaptive detection.** Live tail windows scale with the real tmux pane width (capped 4x), so a narrow pane that wraps a spinner frame across many physical rows no longer classifies a working agent as idle; the detectors are folded into the primary agent APIs ([f0388b69](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/f0388b69), [e6ef5764](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/e6ef5764)).
- **Composer visibility and delivery readiness.** InspectComposer surfaces unsubmitted_input and queued_messages on `--robot-is-working` panes and `--robot-status` agents, the dispatch deliverer refuses typed prompts to panes whose screen positively shows neither composer marker nor working chrome (a typed, retryable failure instead of a silent swallow), and the queued-message footer is detected only on the live tail ([f0388b69](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/f0388b69), [fb6c8657](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/fb6c8657)).
- **Rate limits, spawn grammar, and Agent Mail parity.** Codex/Gemini usage-limit banners are detected on every surface with best-effort reset hints, robot spawn flags accept the CLI's `count:model@effort` grammar with `INVALID_FLAG` before any tmux mutation, and Agent Mail identity is registered on add/adopt and re-registered by the whole relaunch family ([7982a5e6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/7982a5e6)).
- **Ergonomics and models.** `--version`, a `--message` alias, and did-you-mean flag hints ([98a954f8](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/98a954f8)); handoff `--auto` infers goal/now from captured recent pane output ([c9d62f35](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/c9d62f35)); and the models registry gains Claude 5 family aliases at 200k context ([5f070f1f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/5f070f1f)).

### Reliability

- **CM MCP client rewrite (#249).** NTM now speaks MCP JSON-RPC at the cm daemon root instead of invented REST routes, surfaces HTTP-200-with-JSON-RPC-error bodies as real failures instead of dropping context silently, matches CM's history-snippet wire schema, and health-checks through the MCP client -- with a fake MCP daemon standing in for tests ([6935c2d8](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/6935c2d8), [b3dc8346](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/b3dc8346), [398531ec](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/398531ec)).
- **Interactive gates never restart.** Shared gate detection (trust dialogs, auth/login gates, onboarding screens) drives health, is-working, session-health, and the fleet overview out of the false-healthy bucket with `HealthBlocked` and the gate text as reason; health prescribes MANUAL_INTERVENTION instead of restart; and restart prompt delivery gates on composer readiness with typed `RESTART_PROMPT_NOT_DELIVERED` / `SHELL_NOT_RETURNED` failures instead of typing into a bare shell ([edcc7d43](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/edcc7d43), [32cc2ade](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/32cc2ade), [a7b07644](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/a7b07644)).
- The installer probes SHA256SUMS before checksums.txt without printing expected 404s (#247) ([d9d114e1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d9d114e1), [3f69f016](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/3f69f016)); project overlays may only disable integrations, never enable them ([57a18c39](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/57a18c39)); spawn re-renders launch commands after assignment policy ([7e875979](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/7e875979)); usage-limit banner vocabulary is deduplicated ([debbf943](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/debbf943)); and send idempotency is bound to the input command with output-seq row GC ([d233570f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d233570f)).

## [v1.22.1] -- 2026-08-06 [GitHub Release]

**1 commit since v1.22.0** -- default both Claude and Codex reasoning effort to xhigh ([1110bce2](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/1110bce2)).

---

## [v1.22.0] -- 2026-08-06 [GitHub Release]

**386 commits since v1.21.0** -- a fleet-scale hardening release: repeated adversarial fresh-eyes audit waves over serve, robot, swarm, and tmux; real Claude credential isolation; fail-closed contracts everywhere; durable workflow state; and a test suite made trustworthy under live-fleet load.

### Features

- **Durable workflow and swarm state.** Per-pane prompt sequences persisted under `.ntm` with documented review rotations, workflow pause/stage state and runtime transition triggers that survive restarts, a dashboard panel that polls and toggles durable workflow state, and evidence-backed swarm productivity convergence reporting through robot output ([903d459a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/903d459a), [48b2d3c6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/48b2d3c6), [b08eb8bd](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/b08eb8bd), [cf9406f5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/cf9406f5)).
- **Verified delivery evidence.** Optional `--verify-render` captures rendered proof that a robot-send actually reached the pane, pinned by a real-tmux rendered-delivery test ([f83b951a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/f83b951a), [499be1f5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/499be1f5)).
- **Canonical pane selectors everywhere.** `N` / `W.P` / `%ID` selectors accepted across `health --pane`, rotate, activity, and watch, with correct pane IDs in multi-window sessions ([0b41028d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/0b41028d), [d8c0ed03](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d8c0ed03)).
- **Live capture backpressure.** A backpressure tracker for overload snapshots plus single-owner pipe-pane claims so concurrent streamers cannot fight over one pane ([361d406f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/361d406f), [a6ac0188](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/a6ac0188)).
- Cursor dependency detection now checks for the Cursor Agent CLI rather than the IDE binary (#233), and per-pane Claude credential isolation lands as a first-class spawn feature (#237) ([ce4c337f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/ce4c337f), [8b0be5a7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/8b0be5a7)).

### Reliability

- **Security: audit, redaction, and approvals.** Closed three mail read paths that bypassed secret redaction, gave each audit writer its own hash chain, rotated and pruned audit JSONL by retention with write failures counted, and fixed three concurrency defects in approvals, the scanner, and the audit store ([b5296509](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/b5296509), [a0b14f4b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/a0b14f4b), [ff685137](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/ff685137), [98449f40](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/98449f40)).
- **Claude credential isolation made real.** The token no longer leaks through the launch environment, macOS no longer claims an isolation success it did not achieve, and isolation survives controller relaunch and session restore ([e27382ba](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/e27382ba)).
- **Fail closed, everywhere.** Serve safety-policy status, unsafe batch rotation, inaccessible Keychain credentials, assignment lock-cancellation races, and live CAAM/RCH failure contracts all fail closed instead of open, and tmux errors are classified on stderr rather than on the argv that carries agent prompts ([dda4aae8](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/dda4aae8), [d9a37979](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d9a37979), [851959c9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/851959c9), [ac3a4847](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/ac3a4847)).
- **Fresh-eyes audit waves.** Repeated adversarial review passes over recent agent work produced and fixed dozens of findings across serve, robot, swarm, checkpoint, and session restore -- including a restore that would silently drop agents, a circuit breaker that never half-opened, and CAAM account rotation broken against the current CLI ([1e8d4770](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/1e8d4770), [4125df5f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/4125df5f), [d9e12d20](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d9e12d20), [59414dcc](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/59414dcc)).
- Recursive directory watches with `**` path patterns in workflows, and the Windows build restored after a Unix-only process-group kill ([3a14b4f6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/3a14b4f6), [85851434](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/85851434)).

### Verification And Release

- Made the suite trustworthy on a loaded machine: wall-clock budgets scale under live agent-fleet load, completion tests wait on pane PIDs rather than session removal, and load-sensitive fixtures are isolated ([11e74e88](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/11e74e88)).
- Expanded real-tmux send E2E coverage and proved rendered send delivery in live panes ([3929cac0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/3929cac0), [499be1f5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/499be1f5)).

## [v1.21.0] -- 2026-08-04 [GitHub Release]

**116 commits since v1.20.0** -- agent lifecycle verbs, verified prompt delivery with stranded-composer rescue, liveness-gated sends, durable attention correctness, enforced encryption-at-rest, and a GitHub issue triage sweep (#230-#242).

### Features

- **Agent lifecycle verbs.** Graceful `exit-cli` and `kill-agent` without destroying the pane, per-pane removal via `ntm kill --pane` / `--robot-kill-pane`, bounded `rotate --force` for wedged CLIs, an incident-resolve verb with loud empty-flag errors, and per-pane addressing cards with stable `%pane_id` ([50618431](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/50618431), [340eb348](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/340eb348), [e00f81df](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/e00f81df), [8a2676ae](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/8a2676ae), [2b1c46f6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/2b1c46f6)).
- **Verified prompt delivery.** Claude and Codex submissions are verified after delivery with picker-stranded prompts rescued (#241), `--clear-input` gives verified pre-send composer hygiene, `--msg-file -` reads payloads from stdin to shield them from command-safety scanners with oversize detection instead of silent truncation, and `--all` excludes the user pane unless `--include-user` ([049b58dc](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/049b58dc), [9d4e426b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/9d4e426b), [423b43c1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/423b43c1), [d53550ea](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d53550ea), [059eb691](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/059eb691)).
- **Liveness and readiness gates.** Agent-process liveness refuses sends to panes whose CLI is a bare shell, a structured `wake_ping` probe checks rate-limit liveness, spawn `--verify-boot` fails loudly when agents never reach a prompt, and robot-wait gains `agent_ready` and `rate_limit_lifted` conditions to retire post-relaunch sleep folklore ([7bebf88f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/7bebf88f), [51f96e2c](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/51f96e2c), [617fb71b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/617fb71b), [d3c72d57](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d3c72d57), [b5eed774](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/b5eed774)).
- **Spawn and restart controls.** `model@effort` variant suffixes for per-spawn reasoning effort, `--restart-model` / `--restart-agent-args` relaunch overrides, `pane_started_at` / agent-uptime evidence in pane records, dialog classification with policy-gated answering, and `robot-tail --fresh` forcing direct live capture ([ffc172a8](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/ffc172a8), [19338fec](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/19338fec), [32c31cce](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/32c31cce), [202a81c9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/202a81c9), [be69d537](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/be69d537)).

### Reliability

- **Durable attention correctness.** `--robot-snapshot --since` reads the durable attention feed, ephemeral heartbeats no longer consume durable cursors, and routing never recommends excluded or bare-shell panes and actually rotates stateless round-robin by anchor ([d20b9a35](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d20b9a35), [fb51b398](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/fb51b398), [e8a30bca](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/e8a30bca)).
- **GitHub issue triage sweep (#230-#242).** Workspace-trust dialogs classify as ERROR rather than OK (#230), added agents register with Agent Mail (#240), epic container types are excluded from auto-dispatch (#242), spawn recovery-source timeouts degrade to partial recovery (#232), and the stale parser works with canonical idle (#234) ([b845f3f6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/b845f3f6), [5a7d1fbe](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/5a7d1fbe), [e5983245](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/e5983245), [1eb864d0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/1eb864d0), [9f8424fd](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/9f8424fd)).
- **Serve and audit integrity.** The audit middleware is actually installed so mutating actions get recorded, projectDir reads stop racing, workflow paths are confined, authentication is usable with the WebSocket CSRF hole closed, and encryption-at-rest is enforced rather than best-effort with analytics reading event logs through the honoring path ([fecaa0cc](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/fecaa0cc), [487ac3a7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/487ac3a7), [a115fe49](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/a115fe49), [810bee1b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/810bee1b)).
- Closed the 70-finding self-audit backlog, all six P0s first: prompts delivered intact, idle shells no longer reported as crashed, cursor and numeric defects that hid live data repaired, readiness and acknowledgments never fabricated, and auto-restart/timeline checkpointing no longer destroy state ([054edd0e](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/054edd0e), [78341980](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/78341980), [bd4fc018](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/bd4fc018), [8a99a5b3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/8a99a5b3)).

### Verification And Release

- README flag-drift gate: every `ntm` example flag must exist in the CLI registry ([cb4141b6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/cb4141b6)); the Go toolchain moves to 1.26.5 with all direct dependencies at latest ([e0881df8](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/e0881df8)); the double-Ctrl+C exit timing contract is pinned ([1b279c80](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/1b279c80)); and encryption-at-rest is driven through the real binary end-to-end ([aa5b908b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/aa5b908b)).

## [v1.20.0] -- 2026-07-21 [GitHub Release]

**82 commits since v1.19.1** -- atomic agent assignment, canonical pane identity, unified robot contracts, first-class Grok Build launch support, and substantially broader real-tmux verification.

### Features

- **Atomic assignment and reassignment.** Every assignment surface now uses one claim -> reserve -> dispatch coordinator with cross-process locking, generation-scoped delivery identities, durable ledger replicas, fail-closed rollback, and tracker-proven reopen behavior ([85bda87b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/85bda87b), [2a5bbf90](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/2a5bbf90), [fb16d569](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/fb16d569)).
- **Canonical pane targeting and unified dispatch.** Stable pane IDs, strict `N` / `window.pane` / `%id` selectors, topology-aware send behavior, and one shared dispatch application service now cover CLI, robot, scheduler, coordinator, and TUI paths ([0ea6c5c5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/0ea6c5c5), [3344430d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/3344430d), [6087eca3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/6087eca3)).
- **Fresh, confidence-scored observation.** Session state estimates carry capture time, confidence, and evidence; actuation revalidates freshness before dispatch, and coordinator auto-assignment only targets freshly observed idle agents ([65a20b55](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/65a20b55), [1ce5e680](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/1ce5e680), [ec20c417](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/ec20c417)).
- **Robot-mode contract hardening.** Commands emit one stable JSON envelope, typed failures determine process exit status, selectors are canonical, sensitive interrupt follow-ups are redacted, and discovery/capability output is more concise and truthful ([222b57da](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/222b57da), [0bee4911](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/0bee4911), [1a39a4da](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/1a39a4da)).
- **Grok Build phase one.** Added first-class `grok` configuration, CLI add plus CLI/robot/REST spawn surfaces, configured default-model and exact `--effort` forwarding, stable-process and idle-pane launch admission, process/model discovery, counts, schemas, plain Ctrl+C interrupt support, optional doctor/dependency reporting, and topology-only saved-session restore. Authenticated-TUI prompt delivery, assignment, interrupt retasking, restart, and restore-time relaunch fail closed before pane mutation ([4bcb6fef](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/4bcb6fef)).
- **Configurable operator approval gates.** Global and project `[assign] operator_gated_labels` extend the built-in, case-insensitive gate vocabulary without allowing a repository to remove operator protections (#223) ([6761798a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/6761798a)).
- **Persistent coordinator toggles.** `coordinator enable|disable` now updates the selected config atomically, preserves unrelated content and symlink targets, serializes concurrent writers, validates digest intervals and the strict NTM schema, and reports the exact persisted values in JSON (#223) ([6761798a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/6761798a)).

### Reliability

- Reconcile assignment ledgers and reservations without stealing live work; propagate the resolved project directory to every `br` subprocess; bind saved sessions to authoritative agent sessions ([fc6cba92](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/fc6cba92), [6dc42ece](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/6dc42ece), [268489d7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/268489d7)).
- Bound assignment observation by the dispatch freshness window, preserve explicit shorter deadlines, and guarantee timeout failures leave Beads, ledgers, Agent Mail, and panes unchanged ([045c4a37](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/045c4a37), [f05c0ad8](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/f05c0ad8)).
- Honor disabled scheduler configuration, tighten pipeline cancellation, isolate serve-side host integrations, and make support-bundle probes hermetic ([79017882](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/79017882), [09c618f0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/09c618f0), [5840f61a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/5840f61a)).
- Make the dependency-aware `bv --robot-plan` a mandatory automated-assignment boundary; reject command, parse, structure, blank-ID, and live-label coverage failures, replace stale triage labels with authoritative `br` state, and retain plan-only epic operator gates (#224).
- Strictly load assignment policy from the project that owns the Beads workspace before retry, reassign, rebalance, coordinator, robot assign, robot bulk, robot spawn, watch, or distribute work. Cross-project robot and distribute commands now honor custom gates, and live distribute dispatch revalidates every eligibility field immediately before delivery.
- Removed the unused `[health]` TOML section and made `[resilience]` the single restart/monitoring configuration. Existing `[health]` files now fail strict unknown-field validation and must be migrated; the `ntm health` command is unchanged.
- Refuse repo-scoped hook writes through redirected `core.hooksPath`, and reject unusable worktree repositories before any pane or session mutation ([26cf34a4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/26cf34a4), [7d7f70d8](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/7d7f70d8)).
- Preserve DCG pre-send verdicts for leading-dash and bulleted command candidates (#228), rebuild and retry recognized Beads database corruption once under the guarded mutation boundary (#227), and classify pane activity from each pane's own content changes so a busy neighbor cannot pin `wait --completion` (#213) ([060e6cb3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/060e6cb3), [34e41a11](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/34e41a11), [b8787274](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/b8787274)).
- Bound Agent Mail availability discovery to one sub-two-second deadline across lock contention, retries, and backoff; retry only transient transport, timeout, busy, 408, 425, 429, and 5xx failures; fail permanent errors after one probe; preserve cancellation state; and surface the terminal cause to CLI callers.
- Run assignment-mutation policy preflight without unrelated projection refreshes, preserving zero-side-effect failures when selected or target-project configuration is invalid ([de487f7f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/de487f7f)).
- Preserve missing `bv` and `br` identities through assignment planning so robot recommendation and bulk surfaces return `DEPENDENCY_MISSING`; validate robot assignment policy before optional projection refresh; and classify unauthorized rebalance or reassign generations as `BEAD_INELIGIBLE` without mutation.

### Verification And Release

- Added real-tmux dashboard, assignment, reassignment, timeout, recovery, coordinator, robot bulk/spawn, watch, and distribute coverage, including process-boundary assertions for durable side effects, authoritative cross-project policy, malformed planning data, and zero-side-effect failures ([71f66f64](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/71f66f64), [43048fa3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/43048fa3), [90010945](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/90010945)).
- Hardened DSR quality gates across macOS paths, race scheduling, terminal capability detection, private tmux-server isolation, primary E2E, and legacy bulk E2E ([bc4f7a68](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/bc4f7a68), [08acf37b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/08acf37b), [b43dff17](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/b43dff17), [5a5bdc85](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/5a5bdc85)).
- Kept real-tmux verification portable under long or capacity-constrained temp roots, and replaced scheduler-sensitive cancellation and worktree checks with bounded, deterministic synchronization.
- Strict upgrade verification now accepts DSR's native macOS architecture artifacts while retaining exact legacy `darwin_all` support.
- Added built-binary Agent Mail E2E coverage for permanent one-shot failure, bounded transient exhaustion, and successful transient recovery.
- Expanded built-binary assignment E2E coverage for terminal Beads, fail-closed label enrichment, missing `bv` and `br`, completion lease takeover, generation conflicts, reservation refusal, spawn cancellation, and zero-side-effect policy rejection; completion watchers now use immutable per-process fixtures, and direct replay assertions derive pane identity from the isolated tmux topology.
- Added the canonical `VERSION` marker used by DSR version detection ([c727c38d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/c727c38d)).

## [v1.19.1] -- 2026-07-06 [GitHub Release]

**1 commit since v1.19.0** -- make orphan-process reaping portable to Windows ([04877bc6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/04877bc6)).

---

## [v1.19.0] -- 2026-07-06 [Tag Only]

**35 commits since v1.18.3** -- first-class Antigravity agents, safer autonomous swarms, and dashboard/robot improvements.

### Features

- Added Antigravity (`agy`) as a first-class provider across spawning, session discovery, resume, models, docs, and aliases ([abbd51a9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/abbd51a9), [ea023fd7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/ea023fd7), [e488e980](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/e488e980)).
- Added per-pane `CODEX_HOME` isolation and safe account rotation, semantic progress tokens, plugin model resolution, and faithful window/session restoration ([12fd6c41](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/12fd6c41), [ecdcfcd5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/ecdcfcd5), [4f75a99b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/4f75a99b), [a3b9d840](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/a3b9d840)).

### Bug Fixes

- Hardened autonomous dispatch, agent idle detection, robot restart/send behavior, dashboard overlays, palette messaging, health probes, and typed robot failures ([bef7ffcb](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/bef7ffcb), [e250fd5a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/e250fd5a), [d291ffe3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d291ffe3), [d84ee534](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d84ee534)).

---

## [v1.18.3] -- 2026-06-11 [GitHub Release]

**38 commits since v1.18.2** -- saved-session lifecycle, Codex goal controls, topology-aware robot operations, and macOS/test hardening.

### Features

- Added save/list/resume/archive with agent-session state, Codex goal lifecycle and palette-state commands, and structured Agent Mail lock failure codes ([507e6138](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/507e6138), [f8259311](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/f8259311), [c8a5018e](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/c8a5018e), [069fe4be](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/069fe4be)).

### Bug Fixes

- Made pane addressing window-aware, failed loudly on untargetable robot actions, captured only visible Codex preflight state, and resumed the correct Claude session ([0e5fbcd5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/0e5fbcd5), [d5ca3b95](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d5ca3b95), [4ec77ee4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/4ec77ee4), [e68d9d72](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/e68d9d72)).
- Corrected invalid project overlays, actionable assignment filtering, terminal resize repainting, symlink checks, and macOS path/test behavior ([122d517d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/122d517d), [74f9b601](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/74f9b601), [6615dd7d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/6615dd7d), [89811b9a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/89811b9a)).

---

## [v1.18.2] -- 2026-05-21 [GitHub Release]

**2 commits since v1.18.1** -- widen the idle-prompt scan window while preserving spinner ordering, and refresh release history ([e28763ea](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/e28763ea), [1635316b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/1635316b)).

---

## [v1.18.1] -- 2026-05-20 [GitHub Release]

**2 commits since v1.18.0** — Codex preflight no longer over-rejects ChatGPT/OAuth users.

### Bug Fixes

- **Stop hard-rejecting `gpt-*-codex` on ChatGPT/OAuth logins.** The preflight assumed every `gpt-*-codex` id fails with HTTP 400 on ChatGPT-billed accounts, but that is not universal — recent Codex CLI + ChatGPT plans run `gpt-5.3-codex` and answer prompts fine. The local Codex CLI is now the source of truth: an explicit `gpt-*-codex` model on a ChatGPT login emits a non-blocking advisory and proceeds (capability preserved), with `NTM_CODEX_PREFLIGHT_STRICT=1` to opt back into a hard block (#155) ([0fe72100](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/0fe72100))
- Reattach an orphaned `waitForAgentsReady` doc comment ([76306f90](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/76306f90))

---

## [v1.18.0] -- 2026-05-20 [GitHub Release]

**10 commits since v1.17.0** — `--profile-set` becomes a first-class persona spawn contract, plus cross-surface fixes.

### Features

- **`--profile-set` / `--profiles` now drive the spawn.** A persona set expands into concrete, ordered agents *before* pane creation — each agent takes its persona's own `agent_type`, model, and prompt, so a persona can never silently run the wrong agent CLI. Adds fail-closed validation on count/type conflicts, deterministic pane assignment, persona-named pane titles, and a machine-readable persona→pane mapping in the spawn JSON (#149) ([779c3a47](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/779c3a47), [dcddd71b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/dcddd71b), [990e08e4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/990e08e4))
- **Alias-aware pane filtering** for robot history ([978f614a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/978f614a))

### Bug Fixes

- Surface `assign.prompt_template` / `prompt_template_file` in `config diff` for parity with `config show`/`get` (#153) ([358ceb5d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/358ceb5d))
- Clamp exported timeline events to the requested time range with carry-in state ([82d270b6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/82d270b6))
- Propagate IO errors and fix a temp-file leak in the context-pending rotation store ([f50e8145](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/f50e8145))
- Tighten the Codex/Gemini "limited" quota regex against neutral quota prose ([17eb10a2](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/17eb10a2))
- Regression test locking in that expanded personas survive `normalizeSpawnOptions` ([fb02449d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/fb02449d))

---

## [v1.17.0] -- 2026-05-20 [GitHub Release]

**1 commit since v1.16.3** — project-level default for the assign dispatch template.

### Features

- **Config-driven default bulk-assign dispatch template.** New `[assign] prompt_template` / `prompt_template_file` keys let a project pin its dispatch contract (e.g. "Read SKILL.md", "Set gc.outcome when done") instead of wrapping every `--robot-bulk-assign` call. Resolution precedence: per-invocation `--bulk-assign-template` > configured file > configured inline > built-in const (#153) ([1db27e35](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/1db27e35))

---

## [v1.16.3] -- 2026-05-20 [GitHub Release]

**1 commit since v1.16.2** — worktree CLI correctness.

### Bug Fixes

- **Worktree fixes:** manually-provisioned worktrees are now cleanable by `clean-session` (consistent branch naming), `clean-session` reports the actual count removed instead of false success, and `worktree list --json` emits JSON (#150, #151, #152) ([87a948b7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/87a948b7))

---

## [v1.16.2] -- 2026-05-20 [GitHub Release]

**1 commit since v1.16.1** — Codex model default.

### Bug Fixes

- Default Codex agents to `gpt-5.5` instead of the obsolete `gpt-5.3-codex` (#148) ([00e789ea](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/00e789ea))

---

## [v1.16.1] -- 2026-05-20 [GitHub Release]

**4 commits since v1.16.0** — Agent Mail and Codex spawn fixes.

### Bug Fixes

- Agent Mail `registration_token` plumbing + overseer via `send_message` (#146) ([7779cbb3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/7779cbb3))
- Respect the resolved Codex model in the ChatGPT-account preflight (#147) ([b61f6584](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/b61f6584))
- Tighten worktree-root + pane-lookup resolution, parse the rch daemon status envelope, allow "." in the lock-path matcher ([d71736b7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d71736b7))
- Fresh-eyes release follow-ups ([308b895a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/308b895a))

---

## [v1.16.0] -- 2026-05-16 [GitHub Release]

**11 commits since v1.15.1** — wrapper-parity fixes and context-cancellation hardening.

### Features

- **Wrapper-parity bundles:** assign/unlock/redact/state fixes ([9a46a801](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/9a46a801)) and spawn/worktrees/switch fixes ([00e5e1a8](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/00e5e1a8))
- Modernize the Claude Code hooks integration and tighten handoff validation ([06090fd0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/06090fd0))

### Bug Fixes

- Make `cmd.Context()` actually cancellable and plumb `context.Context` through the diagnose/fix paths ([880d5799](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/880d5799), [c9aa587c](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/c9aa587c), [a3f79894](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/a3f79894))
- Resolve tmux panes by ID rather than `session:idx` so pane targeting is `pane-base-index` safe ([b540a212](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/b540a212))
- DCG integration: always advertise robot mode, use dcg's actual subcommand names ([44cae8f7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/44cae8f7), [489d235b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/489d235b))

---

## [v1.15.1] -- 2026-05-14 [GitHub Release]

**1 commit since v1.15.0** — docs.

- Correct source-install guidance in the release docs ([401df929](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/401df929))

---

## [v1.15.0] -- 2026-05-14 [GitHub Release]

**951 commits since v1.14.0** — Go 1.26 toolchain, cross-surface state/audit/tool contracts, and symlink-safety hardening.

### Toolchain & Dependencies

- Bump the Go toolchain to 1.26 and refresh the charmbracelet/chromedp vendored stack ([5b4e99f3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/5b4e99f3), [f635b12a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/f635b12a), [7d21473a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/7d21473a))

### Concurrency & Reliability

- Cross-surface cleanups landing the new state/audit/tool contracts across cli/robot/tui/swarm/ollama/bv/cass/archive/util/webhook/serve ([00457000](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/00457000))
- Avoid deadlocks under load and surface rate-limit "cleared" transitions across resilience/status/summary/metrics/events ([36213942](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/36213942))
- Tighten migration TX rollback, expand SQLite pragmas, and stabilise timeline persistence ([8f6693f4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/8f6693f4))
- Retry SQLite-locked errors per call and double-check writers under contention ([281bbab0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/281bbab0))
- Harden resilience PID/stream cancellation; respect scheduler `GlobalMax` in waiter wake-ups ([1565c8f7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/1565c8f7), [0aa56e4e](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/0aa56e4e))
- Recursively register newly-created watcher subdirectories and drop descendant entries on removal/rename ([bfa272c1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/bfa272c1))

### Security Hardening

- Reject symlinked saved profiles, persona prompt files outside the project, and incremental-diff symlink writes ([9364afc1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/9364afc1), [bdb0966f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/bdb0966f), [46be3f95](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/46be3f95))
- Skip symlink files in directory bundles; resolve git hook paths safely ([b424537d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/b424537d), [346204e8](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/346204e8))

### Locks & Coordination

- Add the `ntm locks check` API for wrapper-contract callers; own-holder priority + empty-pattern guard ([98dff276](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/98dff276), [f21b54e0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/f21b54e0))
- Ignore malformed reservation expiries and shared reservations in `check` ([0da61910](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/0da61910), [475ed187](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/475ed187))
- Harden Agent Mail pane-identity files ([d031eb0e](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d031eb0e))

### Pipeline & Assignment

- Split pipeline substitution into seal-retaining vs seal-restoring variants so foreach materialisation never double-substitutes; preserve persisted StepResults for resume-suppressed iterations ([804268f3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/804268f3), [6a607dfe](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/6a607dfe))
- Compare agent types canonically so allowed-type checks survive provider aliases; deterministic agent-to-bead selection across strategies ([66ab6887](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/66ab6887), [c9aaba3e](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/c9aaba3e))

---

## [v1.14.0] -- 2026-04-24 [GitHub Release]

**26 commits since v1.13.1** — Claude Code model snapshot/restore and operator-prompt fixes.

### Features

- **Snapshot/restore the Claude Code model setting** across the swarm lifecycle, so per-swarm model overrides don't leak into the user's global Claude Code config (#110) ([29f6efbe](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/29f6efbe), [d27cf24f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/commit/d27cf24f))

### Bug Fixes
