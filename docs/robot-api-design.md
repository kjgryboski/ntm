# Robot Mode API Design Principles

> **Authoritative Reference** for NTM robot mode API design.
> All robot commands MUST follow these principles for consistency.

## Overview

NTM's robot mode provides a JSON API for AI agents and automation tools to interact with tmux sessions and agent orchestration. This document establishes the canonical patterns that ensure a coherent, intuitive, and ergonomic interface.

**Design Goals:**
1. **Predictable** - Consistent patterns across all commands
2. **Discoverable** - Self-documenting via `--robot-capabilities`
3. **Ergonomic** - Minimal typing, logical flag names
4. **Correct** - Do it right with no tech debt (no backwards compatibility guarantees in early development)

---

## 1. Command Naming Patterns

### 1.1 Core Session Operations

Session-scoped commands use `=SESSION` syntax:

```bash
--robot-send=SESSION        # Send prompts to agents
--robot-tail=SESSION        # Capture pane output
--robot-spawn=SESSION       # Create new session
--robot-context=SESSION     # Get context window usage
--robot-wait=SESSION        # Wait for agent states
--robot-interrupt=SESSION   # Send Ctrl+C to agents
--robot-activity=SESSION    # Get agent activity state
--robot-health=SESSION      # Get session health
--robot-diagnose=SESSION    # Comprehensive health check
```

### 1.2 Global Commands

Commands that operate globally (no session context) are bool flags:

```bash
--robot-status              # List all sessions
--robot-version             # Version info
--robot-plan                # bv global plan
--robot-tools               # Tool inventory
--robot-capabilities        # API discovery
--robot-provider-capabilities # Provider transport/profile discovery (redacted, local-only)
--robot-provider-conformance  # Synthetic/offline provider adapter contract check
--robot-grok-acp-run          # Native Grok ACP operation (exact provider profile required)
--robot-grok-acp-receipt=ID   # Read durable Grok ACP operation receipt
--robot-snapshot            # Unified state dump
--robot-triage              # bv triage analysis
--robot-dashboard           # Dashboard summary
```

### 1.3 Tool Bridges

External tool integrations follow `--robot-<tool>-<action>` pattern with **separate modifier flags**:

```bash
# CORRECT: Bool flag + separate modifiers
ntm --robot-jfp-search --query="debugging" --limit=10
ntm --robot-cass-search --query="auth error" --since=7d
ntm --robot-xf-search --query="rust async" --limit=20
ntm --robot-dcg-check --command="rm -rf /data"
ntm --robot-mail-check --project=myproj --agent=cc_1

# AVOID: Inline values in main flag (legacy pattern)
ntm --robot-jfp-search="debugging"      # Deprecated
ntm --robot-cass-search="auth error"    # Deprecated
```

### 1.3.1 Flywheel Tool Bridges (Inventory + Wrappers)

Use the tool inventory to discover what is available on the current machine:

```bash
ntm --robot-tools
```

Tool bridges are **optional**. When a tool is missing, robot commands return `DEPENDENCY_MISSING` with an actionable hint. Use `--robot-tools` and `--robot-capabilities` to confirm which wrappers are supported in your build.

**Implemented today**
- **JFP** (JeffreysPrompts): `--robot-jfp-status`, `--robot-jfp-list`, `--robot-jfp-search`, `--robot-jfp-show`, `--robot-jfp-suggest`, `--robot-jfp-install`, `--robot-jfp-export`, `--robot-jfp-update`, `--robot-jfp-installed`, `--robot-jfp-categories`, `--robot-jfp-tags`, `--robot-jfp-bundles`
- **ACFS** (Flywheel setup/bootstrapping): `--robot-acfs-status` (alias: `--robot-setup`)
- **MS** (Meta Skill): `--robot-ms-search`, `--robot-ms-show`
- **DCG** (Destructive Command Guard): `--robot-dcg-status`
- **SLB** (two-person approvals): `--robot-slb-pending`, `--robot-slb-approve`, `--robot-slb-deny`
- **RU** (repo updater): `--robot-ru-sync` — shipped
- **GIIL** (image fetch): `--robot-giil-fetch` — shipped
- **XF** (archive search): `--robot-xf-search`, `--robot-xf-status` — shipped

**Planned / rolling out** (names follow `--robot-<tool>-<action>`; confirm via `--robot-capabilities`)
- **UBS** (Ultimate Bug Scanner): `--robot-ubs-*` (the human CLI already ships `ntm scan` / `ntm bugs`)

### 1.4 Resource Lookups

Simple ID/path lookups MAY use inline values:

```bash
--robot-bead-show=bd-123        # Single bead by ID
--robot-bead-claim=bd-123       # Claim bead by ID
--robot-forecast=bd-123         # Forecast for bead
--robot-impact=src/main.go      # Impact for file
--robot-schema=status           # Schema for type
```

---

## 2. Parameter Patterns

### 2.1 Global Shared Modifiers

These flags are shared across many commands and MUST NOT be tool-prefixed:

| Flag | Description | Used With |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| `--limit=N` | Max results to return | search, list commands |
| `--offset=N` | Pagination offset | list commands |
| `--since=DATE` | Start date filter | search, history, diff |
| `--until=DATE` | End date filter | search commands |
| `--panes=1,2,3` | Filter to specific panes | session commands |
| `--all` | Include user pane (default: agent panes only) | send, interrupt |
| `--lines=N` | Lines to capture | tail, inspect |
| `--query=Q` | Search query | search commands |
| `--type=T` | Filter by agent type | send, ack, interrupt, activity, wait, route, history |
| `--attention-session=S` | Filter attention by session | attention |
| `--timeout=D` | Operation timeout | wait, ack, interrupt |
| `--verbose` | Detailed output | status, health commands |
| `--dry-run` | Preview without executing | send, spawn, restart |
| `--output=PATH` | Output file path | save, monitor |

Note: `--robot-limit` and `--robot-offset` are accepted as explicit aliases for robot list outputs (status, snapshot, history). Unprefixed flags remain canonical.

**Example (Correct):**
```bash
ntm --robot-cass-search --query="auth" --limit=20 --since=7d
ntm --robot-alerts --alerts-type=error --alerts-session=myproject
ntm --robot-wait=myproject --timeout=2m --panes=1,2
```

**Example (Deprecated):**
```bash
ntm --robot-cass-search="auth" --cass-limit=20 --cass-since=7d  # Old pattern
ntm --robot-alerts --type=error --session=myproject  # Old pattern
```

### 2.2 Tool-Specific Modifiers

Only use tool prefix for options unique to that tool:

| Flag | Description | Why Prefixed |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `--spawn-cc=N` | Claude agents to spawn | spawn-specific |
| `--spawn-cod=N` | Codex agents to spawn | spawn-specific |
| `--spawn-agy=N` | Antigravity agents to spawn | spawn-specific |
| `--spawn-grok=N` | Grok Build agents to spawn | spawn-specific |
| `--spawn-zai=N` | Z.ai agents to spawn; requires an exact provider profile | spawn-specific |
| `--provider-profile=NAME` | Exact configured provider identity for `--spawn-zai`, `--robot-grok-acp-run`, or provider conformance | provider-specific |
| `--provider-transport=NAME` | Declared transport for the offline provider conformance harness | provider-specific |
| `--spawn-gmi=N` | Gemini agents to spawn (legacy) | spawn-specific |
| `--spawn-preset=NAME` | Use preset recipe | spawn-specific |
| `--probe-method=M` | Probe detection method | probe-specific |
| `--xf-mode=semantic` | XF search mode | xf-specific |
| `--bulk-strategy=S` | Bulk assign strategy | bulk-assign-specific |

Grok Build supports two evidence-distinct paths. Provider-native one-shot
automation uses ACP JSON-RPC (`grok --no-auto-update --sandbox=read-only --permission-mode=dontAsk
<allow/deny rules> [--model EXACT_MODEL] agent stdio`) and is the primary path.
Every ACP operation requires an exact xAI/Grok provider profile. Optional
`--provider-model` and `--grok-binary` values only assert equality with that
profile; they cannot replace its identity or executable. Admission is keyed by
the full provider/account/model/endpoint/runtime/credential-class/billing-class/
entitlement/config tuple and never selects a fallback identity. These controls
share leases, budgets, backoff, and circuit state across local NTM processes;
they do not claim fleet-wide coordination.
It binds a generated nonce instruction into the prompt and reports completion
only when an assistant text update echoes that exact nonce. The receipt contains
only hashes/counts, provider session and optional structured model/usage fields,
plus observable local exit/cleanup state; it never contains prompts, nonces,
raw output, tool arguments, or credentials. Missing nonce acknowledgement is a
typed operation failure. A post-acceptance timeout is `DISPATCH_UNKNOWN` rather
than a retry-safe failure. On cancellation NTM writes ACP `session/cancel`; the
only accepted acknowledgement is the original matching `session/prompt`
response with `stopReason=cancelled`. The capability scope is `agent_acp`: this
proves the local Grok ACP agent acknowledged that transition, not that xAI
stopped cloud inference. Local process-tree termination, residual-PID
inspection, and reaping are separate `local_process_tree` evidence.
Automated ACP removes `XAI_API_KEY` and all proxy variables from the child
environment (proxy URLs may embed credentials), then authenticates only with
the local Grok CLI's `cached_token`; if that method is unavailable it fails
closed with `GROK_ACP_CACHED_AUTH_UNAVAILABLE`. An exported API key is never an
automated fallback. Exact model identity requires completion metadata
or a structured xAI model notification bound to the returned provider session
and exact launch model. A global provider catalog is availability evidence only
and cannot make a robot operation succeed.
The operation ID is durably bound to the identity, logical prompt, working
directory, canonical executable-path, and policy hashes before provider dispatch; the receipt
separately hashes the exact nonce-bound packet. Normal retries with a newly
generated transport nonce replay the recorded safe outcome, conflicting reuse fails, and an
in-progress/outcome-unknown operation is never stale-taken-over. Query it with
`--robot-grok-acp-receipt=OPERATION_ID` without contacting the provider.

The receipt is runtime-attested only for fields supplied by the structured ACP
protocol, such as a provider session ID, completion status, or model
observation. The profile tuple remains profile-attested: NTM hashes and binds
the configured values but does not claim the opaque runtime independently
proved each value.

Interactive Grok panes are the compatibility fallback for readiness waits,
exact-pane send and assignment, retasking interrupt, restart, and restore-time
relaunch. The named `grok-readonly-ci` policy uses `--no-auto-update`, xAI's
independent `read-only` filesystem sandbox, the headless fail-closed `dontAsk`
mode, explicit allow rules, and deny rules; broad approval bypasses
are not a valid automated launch. Because xAI does not publish a passive
TUI-readiness protocol, NTM requires positive authenticated composer evidence
and fails closed on login screens, modals, errors, rate limits, bare shells,
pre-filled composers, active turns, and unrecognized future UI states. Grok
readiness records `READY` or reason-coded `UNREADY_*` evidence and receives the
actual tmux pane width so line wrapping does not hide a required live signal.
`--spawn-wait` is recommended with `--spawn-assign-work` when the caller
requires readiness-gated spawn evidence; assignment still performs its own fresh
safety observation when the wait flag is omitted.

The default Grok observe policy permits only read/search operations and denies
`Bash(*)`. The separately named workspace-write policy is admitted only in a
linked disposable worktree; it uses the `strict` sandbox, permits edits, and
denies provider-run `Bash(*)` and web tools. Controller-owned verification is
kept separate because executing model-edited code in the credential-bearing
provider process would bypass tool-level path and network denies.

Z.ai launch is provider-profile based, not a broad Claude-runtime target.
`--spawn-zai` requires an exact `--provider-profile` whose immutable provider,
account alias, model, endpoint, runtime, credential class, billing class,
entitlement, and redacted configuration digest form one identity. Coding Plan
profiles must use the official `https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic`
endpoint, `claude-code` runtime, and an executable-only command. Before tmux
mutation, NTM runs a fresh zero-tool, no-session-persistence Claude stream-JSON
probe against the exact endpoint/model with every provider tool disabled. It
requires a top-level successful result whose nonce and session ID match the
same `system/init` record that names the exact model; absence is production
NO-GO. The probe requires the explicit `ZAI_API_KEY`, never forwards a generic
`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, maps the Z.ai key to the one canonical child auth variable, and
strips unrelated inherited credentials. The compiled pane command repeats that
minimal-environment boundary and exits with `NTM_ZAI_AUTH_REQUIRED` if the tmux
environment did not inherit `ZAI_API_KEY`; preflight does not claim otherwise.
The current Coding Plan FAQ lists GLM-5.3 and GLM-5.3-Flash for all plan tiers,
and the switching guide names `glm-5.3-flash` for Claude Code. Even a documented
model is not evidence that the selected account/plan can call it, so the exact
live probe remains mandatory.
The `zai-readonly-ci` policy, endpoint, runtime, and configuration digest are
also profile-attested only: a Claude-compatible Z.ai TUI does not expose enough
structured runtime evidence for NTM to independently prove per-invocation
policy enforcement.

Capacity claims follow the transport boundary. Native Grok ACP calls have
exact-identity request admission with independent concurrency/token buckets,
backoff, circuits, and renewable crash-recoverable leases shared by cooperating
local NTM processes. This remains local rather than fleet-wide. A
Claude-compatible Z.ai TUI
exposes only its process, not each underlying provider call, so NTM applies
exact-identity admission around the live preflight and first authorized pane
launch. Exact structured preflight business errors update the corresponding
backoff/circuit state, but individual TUI model calls and their live errors
remain unobservable, so request-capacity control and TUI live error feedback
are advertised as `unavailable`. It does not infer provider health from a local
launch and never silently changes provider identity.

### 2.2.1 Provider authorization, qualification, and native session contract

Provider identity is an immutable, non-secret authorization boundary: provider,
account alias, model, normalized HTTPS endpoint, runtime, credential class,
billing class, entitlement, and a redacted configuration-manifest SHA-256 are
hashed together. That identity hash keys admission, receipts, capacity, and
qualification. It is profile-attested unless a transport produces narrower
runtime evidence; it is never upgraded merely because a CLI launched, a pane
appeared, or a model is listed in provider documentation.

The two and only two compiled Grok unattended policies are
`grok-readonly-ci` and `grok-workspace-write-ci`. The former is read/search
only. The latter is a narrow workspace-edit policy using xAI's `strict`
sandbox; provider-run shell and web tools stay denied. Test execution is a
separate controller-owned operation under an OS network/PID/filesystem sandbox,
because an allowed test can execute model-edited code and cannot be secured by
tool pattern matching alone. The workspace-write policy is rejected unless its
CWD is a linked disposable Git worktree.
Both policies require the system Grok requirements envelope to be installed,
digest-matched, and administrator/root owned. Installation is explicit,
create-only, requires `--confirm`, and verifies ownership and digest:

```bash
ntm provider policy requirements --policy=grok-readonly-ci --install --confirm
# or, to support both graduated invocation profiles on this host:
ntm provider policy requirements --policy=grok-workspace-write-ci --install --confirm
```

Installation is create-only; these are alternatives, not sequential commands.
The workspace envelope is the maximum root-owned capability, while an observe
invocation remains narrower because its per-run deny rules still take precedence.

`ntm provider doctor --profile=PROFILE` is read-only and offline by default;
`--online` permits exactly one bounded no-tool identity/model probe. It reports
the immutable identity, policy state, runtime pin/drift, credential presence,
capacity/circuit scope, capability limits, and, for the Z.ai Claude-compatible
coding lane, whether a stored qualification receipt is current and binds the
exact identity, transport, and policy. The nine-check suite is not applicable
to provider-native no-tool transports; their online probe remains a
capability-scoped readiness gate, not coding qualification.

`ntm provider session resume` and `ntm provider session fork` are native Grok
headless lifecycle operations, not UI emulation. Each requires an exact native
Grok profile, a non-empty provider session ID and prompt, a matching root-owned
requirements document, a non-drifted reviewed runtime pin, and `local_shared`
cross-process capacity. The workspace-write variant also requires the linked
disposable worktree. A successful operation returns a nonce-bound receipt with
identity/policy/CWD hashes, admission evidence, action, and child-session
lineage hash. The provider session ID, prompt, nonce, raw output, tool
arguments, and credentials are never retained in that receipt. Cancellation
and cleanup can be authoritative for the locally observed process tree while
provider-side cancellation remains unavailable; the capability output exposes
that authority scope explicitly.

Cooperating local NTM processes share exact-identity concurrency, token-bucket,
backoff, and circuit state through a crash-tolerant local store. This is not a
fleet-wide reservation. A process-local fallback is surfaced by doctor and
blocks native headless resume/fork rather than being misrepresented as shared
capacity.

Z.ai Coding Plan and native API access are intentionally different identities:
the Claude-compatible Coding Plan lane accepts only `ZAI_API_KEY`, while the native API lane
requires `ZAI_NATIVE_API_KEY`. Credential class, billing class, and entitlement
are all identity inputs, so one lane cannot borrow the other lane's capacity or
claim its authorization. The native API may have structured completion, usage,
and error evidence, but cancellation and resume remain unavailable until their
own authoritative receipts exist.

The native no-tool path is an explicit one-shot operation, not a coding
qualification or lifecycle substitute:

```bash
ntm provider run --profile=zai-native-no-tools --operation-id=YOUR_UNIQUE_OPERATION_ID --prompt='bounded no-tool task' --live
```

It requires the separately authorized `ZAI_NATIVE_API_KEY` lane, records a
redacted operation-bound receipt, and derives a non-secret request ID from the
durable binding. That ID is sent in the API body and must be echoed exactly by
the successful event stream; a matching response header alone is insufficient.
It must not be promoted to provider-side cancellation, resume, or coding-policy
authority.

Provider doctor reports `GO_SCOPED` when all gates for a declared operation
scope pass but cancellation or cleanup lacks provider-side acknowledgement.
Only provider-authoritative cancellation and cleanup can produce `GO`; scoped
readiness remains a non-zero doctor result so it cannot be promoted silently to
Claude/Codex-equivalent lifecycle control.
The Z.ai Claude-compatible pane lane remains `NO_GO` even after a successful
preflight and current coding-qualification receipt: its opaque runtime has no
per-request capacity/circuit enforcement or structured live-error feedback.
Pane-launch admission is not a reservation or circuit authority for the model
requests subsequently made inside that pane.

`ntm provider qualify --profile=PROFILE --live` is an explicit live-only
qualification for the Z.ai Claude-compatible Coding Plan lane; it rejects
native-API credentials and stores a create-only, self-digested local receipt from a
disposable repository. All nine mandatory checks must pass: `model_identity`,
`workspace_edit`, `test_execution`, `secret_access_denied`, `push_denied`,
`crash_recovery`, `cancellation`, `session_resumption`, and
`zero_residual_cleanup`. **Hard NO-GO:** until doctor finds a current all-nine
live-pass receipt bound to the exact identity, transport, and policy, the lane
is not ready for production coding. This design document does not claim that a
live qualification has occurred. The receipt is unsigned and is not
tamper-evident against the same local account. Machine proof is parsed only
from documented top-level protocol events; model-authored text and stderr are
never accepted as tool-use or permission-denial evidence. The test check runs
after an exact repository-delta check in a cleared-environment Bubblewrap
network/PID/filesystem sandbox.

The production suite is Linux-only. It uses Bubblewrap for the controller-owned
test check; on another platform NTM rejects the default live suite in preflight,
before disposable-repository creation or any provider call. Tests may inject a
verifier, but that is not a production readiness escape hatch. Native no-tool
Z.ai requests remain a separate non-qualification lane.

A matching managed policy, runtime inspection, or configuration digest is only
configuration attestation. It does not turn a local process-tree stop or
cleanup observation into provider-side cancellation acknowledgement.
For Grok, dispatch additionally requires the canonical version-pinned binary
and every parent directory to be root-owned and non-writable by unprivileged
users, followed by a no-network, credential-free Bubblewrap behavioral probe of
that same system-authoritative binary: `--always-approve`
must be refused by the requirements policy after its root-owned, non-writable
file and parent path are revalidated. `grok inspect` remains source/layer
evidence only and cannot substitute for this refusal test.

### 2.3 Aliases for Backward Compatibility

When standardizing flags, keep old prefixed versions as aliases:

```go
// Canonical (new)
rootCmd.Flags().IntVar(&limit, "limit", 20, "Max results to return")
// Alias (deprecated, kept for backward compatibility)
rootCmd.Flags().IntVar(&limit, "cass-limit", 20, "DEPRECATED: use --limit")
```

---

## 3. Output Envelope

All robot commands MUST include these fields:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "timestamp": "2026-01-22T10:30:00Z",
  "error": null,
  "error_code": null,
  "hint": null
}
```

### 3.1 Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "timestamp": "2026-01-22T10:30:00Z",
  "sessions": [...],
  "_agent_hints": {
    "summary": "3 sessions active, 12 agents total"
  }
}
```

### 3.2 Error Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "timestamp": "2026-01-22T10:30:00Z",
  "error": "Session 'myproject' not found",
  "error_code": "SESSION_NOT_FOUND",
  "hint": "Use --robot-status to list available sessions"
}
```

### 3.3 Is-Working Classification Evidence

Each pane returned by `--robot-is-working=SESSION` includes
`indicator_basis`, the authoritative signal that drove its current verdict.
`indicators.work` remains the complete diagnostic list of matching patterns;
it is not itself a precedence explanation.

| `indicator_basis` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `claude_live_spinner` | Claude's most-recent live spinner wins over its bottom-pinned prompt. |
| `claude_finished_turn_prompt` | A completed Claude turn and prompt outrank stale elapsed-time labels. |
| `codex_live_working_indicator` | A current Codex working/interrupt marker is present in the live window. |
| `codex_composer_placeholder` | Codex's `Ask Codex` composer is waiting for input, not working. |
| `canonical_working_observation` / `canonical_idle_observation` | The fresh canonical pane observation safely corrected the parser verdict. |
| `rate_limit_indicator`, `error_indicator`, `parser_work_indicator`, `idle_prompt`, `insufficient_evidence` | The corresponding fallback or terminal signal determined the result. |

Treat a pane waiting on a background terminal as working only when a current
live indicator is present; elapsed labels and old scrollback alone are not
authoritative.

### 3.4 Post-Action Verification Evidence

`success: true` means the requested API operation completed. It is not, by
itself, evidence that an agent consumed a prompt, a newly spawned CLI reached
a usable prompt, or a restart replaced the intended process. Mutating robot
callers MUST use the command-specific evidence below before treating an action
as complete.

| Operation | Evidence to inspect | Meaning and limitations |
|---|---|---|
| `--robot-send` | `targets`, `successful`, and `failed` | A successful target received the tmux delivery attempt. This is dispatch evidence only; it does not prove the agent processed the prompt. |
| `--robot-send` with `--verify-render` | One `render_evidence` entry per target; require `delivered_and_rendered: true` for every target | NTM captures bounded pane output before and after dispatch. `delivered_and_rendered` requires dispatch success, both captures, and a changed rendered output. Missing, unchanged, or unavailable evidence makes the overall response `success: false`; it proves rendered delivery, not prompt comprehension. |
| `--robot-send` with `--track` | `send` plus `ack.confirmations`, `ack.pending`, `ack.failed`, and `ack.timed_out` | The strongest prompt-consumption evidence. A confirmation reports its `ack_type`, time, and latency. Pending or timed-out panes require follow-up; do not retry blindly. |
| `--robot-tail=SESSION --fresh` | Per-pane `capture_collected_at`, `capture_provenance`, and optional `capture_error` | A direct post-action observation. `capture_provenance: "live"` is fresh capture evidence; `"unavailable"` means the pane was not observed and is not evidence of no effect. |
| `--robot-spawn` with `--spawn-wait` | The command waits up to `--timeout` for ready observations | Readiness-gated spawn evidence. Grok requires a positively identified authenticated empty composer; a timeout is an error rather than a claim that all agents booted. Inspect the resulting session with a fresh tail. |
| `--robot-exit-cli`, `--robot-kill-agent`, and restart/relaunch paths | Per-pane `results`, including `shell_pid`, `agent_pids`, `shell_preserved`, and `verification_failed`; restart output also includes `pane_shell_pids`, `process_alive`, and relaunch status | Process/lifecycle evidence. `verification_failed` means observation failed, not that a pane was destroyed. A respawn must show a changed `pane_shell_pids.after`; unchanged or absent PID evidence is not a verified restart. |

The durable attention feed mirrors actuation progress as `request`, `outcome`,
and `verification` events. For tracked sends, the verification event records
the target set, confirmations, pending targets, timeout state, and one of
`confirmed`, `partial_timeout`, `timed_out`, or `pending`. It is suitable for
asynchronous monitoring; command responses remain the primary evidence for the
specific invocation.

### 3.5 Provider Capability Discovery

`--robot-provider-capabilities` is a local, read-only discovery surface. It
returns the static transport evidence matrix, the compiled-in named Grok policy
(name, sandbox, permission mode, digest, and rule counts), and the offline conformance
harness description. When a configuration is loaded it adds only redacted
provider-profile projections: selector and immutable identity hashes,
exact-target/probe flags, and model-probe state. It never emits executable
commands, endpoints, credentials, API keys, raw configuration, prompts, or
provider output. Config-valid xAI profiles report
`operation_evidence_required`; Z.ai profiles report `live_probe_required`.
Neither state claims the account or operation has been qualified.

The matrix is a contract for the evidence a transport can produce, not proof
that a local account is enabled or qualified. In particular, an exact Z.ai
profile still needs its fresh nonce-bound live probe before launch. Grok ACP
cancellation is `authoritative/agent_acp` only after the original matching
prompt returns `stopReason=cancelled`; its cloud-inference-stop field remains
false because neither ACP nor xAI supplies that receipt. Run the
offline harness explicitly with `--robot-provider-conformance
--provider-profile=NAME
--provider-transport=xai_acp|xai_headless_session|xai_grok_tui|zai_claude_runtime|zai_native_api`. It uses a
compiled redacted synthetic runtime, makes no live provider or network call,
and is not a live qualification result. The report always covers no-write
launch/identity, nonce delivery, exact error taxonomy, cancellation semantics,
crash/outcome-unknown recovery, declared resumption support, and zero-residual
cleanup. Its zero-residual observation is synthetic; a live Grok ACP operation
records its separate observed local process-tree termination and residual-PID
check, while the other transports retain their declared narrower cleanup scope.

For a separate opt-in no-write live Grok ACP check, run
`NTM_LIVE_GROK_ACP=1 NTM_LIVE_GROK_MODEL=grok-4.6 go test -tags=integration ./internal/grok -run '^TestLiveACPReadOnlyRoundTrip$' -count=1 -v`
only in an authenticated Grok environment you are authorized to use. This test
is live evidence for that exact environment; it is not supplied by the
synthetic conformance command.

Example: dispatch a prompt and require bounded downstream evidence rather than
assuming that an accepted keypress was consumed.

```bash
ntm --robot-send=payments --msg='Run focused tests and report the result.' --track --ack-timeout=30s
ntm --robot-send=payments --msg='Run focused tests and report the result.' --verify-render
ntm --robot-tail=payments --fresh --panes=1,2
```

An orchestrator should advance only for panes in `ack.confirmations` (or after
an independently fresh, live observation establishes the intended effect).
It should surface `pending`, `failed`, timed-out, or unavailable capture
results for remediation instead of reporting a verified outcome.

| `DEPENDENCY_MISSING` | Required external tool not installed or vanished mid-run |
| `MISSING_REQUIRED` | Required parameter missing |
| `TIMEOUT` | Operation timed out |
| `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` | Feature not yet available |
| `PERMISSION_DENIED` | Authorization required |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Unexpected internal error |

---

## 4. Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning | When Used |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 0 | Success | Operation completed successfully |
| 1 | Error | Parse error, command failed, invalid input |
| 2 | Unavailable | Tool not installed, NOT_IMPLEMENTED |

**Exit Code Mapping:**
- `TOOL_NOT_FOUND` → exit 2
- `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` → exit 2
- `MISSING_REQUIRED` → exit 1
- `INVALID_FLAG` → exit 1
- `INVALID_ARGS` → exit 1
- `INVALID_INPUT` → exit 1
- `SESSION_NOT_FOUND` → exit 1
- All other errors → exit 1

---

## 5. Pagination Pattern

Commands that return lists MUST support pagination:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "timestamp": "2026-01-22T10:30:00Z",
  "total_matches": 150,
  "offset": 20,
  "count": 10,
  "has_more": true,
  "items": [...],
  "_agent_hints": {
    "next_offset": 30,
    "pages_remaining": 12
  }
}
```

**Required Flags:**
- `--limit=N` - Max items to return (default varies by command)
- `--offset=N` - Skip first N items (default 0)

**Required Response Fields:**
- `total_matches` - Total count before pagination
- `offset` - Current offset echoed back
- `count` - Number of items in current response
- `has_more` - Boolean indicating more results available
- `_agent_hints.next_offset` - Next offset value for convenience

**Status/Snapshot/History Note:** These commands expose pagination under a `pagination` object:
`{limit, offset, count, total, has_more, next_cursor}`.

---

## 6. Array Fields

Critical arrays are ALWAYS present, even if empty:

```json
{
  "sessions": [],
  "agents": [],
  "messages": [],
  "hits": []
}
```

This allows safe iteration without null checks.

---

## 7. Optional Fields

Use `omitempty` for optional fields - they are absent when not applicable:

- `error`, `error_code`, `hint` - Only on error
- `_agent_hints` - Only when hints available
- `variant` - Only if agent has model variant
- `body` - Only when `--include-bodies` set

---

## 8. Agent Hints

Include `_agent_hints` object with actionable suggestions:

```json
{
  "_agent_hints": {
    "summary": "Brief human-readable summary",
    "suggested_action": "What to do next",
    "next_offset": 20,
    "pages_remaining": 5,
    "safer_alternative": "Alternative command if blocked",
    "warnings": ["Any issues to be aware of"]
  }
}
```

---

## 9. Filter Echo Pattern

Commands with multiple filters SHOULD echo the active filters:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "filters": {
    "status": "open",
    "type": "error",
    "session": "myproject",
    "since": "2026-01-01",
    "until": null
  },
  "items": [...]
}
```

This helps agents verify their filters were applied correctly.

---

## 10. Verbose Flag Pattern

The `--verbose` flag is a global modifier that increases output detail.

**When to implement `--verbose`:**
- Safety checks - show analysis details
- Status commands - show extended metadata
- Commands where abbreviated vs detailed output makes sense

**Example (without --verbose):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "allowed": false,
  "severity": "high",
  "rationale": "Destructive command"
}
```

**Example (with --verbose):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "allowed": false,
  "severity": "high",
  "rationale": "Destructive command",
  "analysis": {
    "command_parsed": ["git", "reset", "--hard"],
    "flags_detected": ["--hard"],
    "risk_factors": ["discards uncommitted changes"]
  }
}
```

---

## 11. Documentation Requirements

Every robot command must document:

1. **Command interface** with examples
2. **Output schema** with JSON example
3. **Error response** with JSON example (including error_code)
4. **Modifier flags** table with scope (global/tool-specific)
5. **Exit codes** (must follow standard)
6. **Unit tests** (80% coverage target)

## 12. API Evolution

> **Note:** This project is in early development with no external users. We do not
> maintain backwards compatibility guarantees. See AGENTS.md for the authoritative
> policy: "We do not care about backwards compatibility—we're in early development

- JSON output is the default format
- TOON format is opt-in via `--robot-format=toon`
- Schema changes are made as needed—additive changes are preferred but breaking changes are allowed
- Old prefixed flags may be removed without deprecation period
- If you depend on specific behavior, pin to a specific commit or version

---

## 13. Flag Deprecation Reference

The following prefixed flags are deprecated. Use the canonical unprefixed form:

### CASS Flags
| Deprecated | Canonical |
|------------|-----------|
| `--cass-limit` | `--limit` |
| `--cass-since` | `--since` |
| `--cass-agent` | `--agent` |
| `--cass-workspace` | `--workspace` |

### JFP Flags
| Deprecated | Canonical |
|------------|-----------|
| `--jfp-category` | `--category` |
| `--jfp-tag` | `--tag` |

---

## 14. New Robot Command PR Checklist

Use this checklist when adding or modifying a robot command:

- **Naming:** Global commands are bool flags; session-scoped commands use `=SESSION`.
- **Modifiers:** Prefer global unprefixed flags (`--limit`, `--since`, `--type`). Keep deprecated prefixed aliases when standardizing.
- **Output Envelope:** Always include `success`, `timestamp`, and error fields (`error`, `error_code`, `hint`) per the standard schema.
- **Arrays:** Critical arrays are always present (empty slice, not null or omitted).
- **Pagination:** For list outputs, include `total_matches`, `offset`, `count`, `has_more`, and `_agent_hints.next_offset`.
- **Filters:** Echo active filters in a `filters` object when multiple filters are supported.
- **Errors & Exit Codes:** Use standard error codes and map to exit code 1 or 2 as specified.
- **Determinism:** Ensure stable ordering for arrays and schema fields (especially in JSON).
- **Docs:** Add/refresh examples and schema notes in this document; ensure `--robot-help` points here.
- **Capabilities:** Update `--robot-capabilities` output/schema if new fields or commands are added.
- **Tests:** Add unit tests for flag parsing, validation, and output; add/update E2E script with required log prefix and exit-code assertions.

## 15. JSON Schema Generation

NTM provides built-in JSON Schema generation for all robot command outputs. This enables:

- **Type-safe integration** - Generate client types from schemas
- **Validation** - Validate responses against canonical schemas
- **Documentation** - Auto-generate API docs from schemas

### Usage

```bash
# Simple form (recommended)
ntm --schema status              # Schema for status output
ntm --schema all                 # All available schemas

# Long form (equivalent)
ntm --robot-schema=status
ntm --robot-schema=all
```

### Available Schema Types

| Type | Description | Command |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `status` | Full system status | `--robot-status` |
| `snapshot` | Unified state dump | `--robot-snapshot` |
| `version` | Version information | `--robot-version` |
| `spawn` | Session creation | `--robot-spawn` |
| `send` | Message delivery | `--robot-send` |
| `interrupt` | Agent interruption | `--robot-interrupt` |
| `tail` | Pane output capture | `--robot-tail` |
| `ack` | Send acknowledgment | `--robot-ack` |
| `inspect` | Pane inspection | `--robot-inspect-pane` |
| `ensemble` | Ensemble state | `--robot-ensemble` |
| `ensemble_spawn` | Ensemble creation | `--robot-ensemble-spawn` |
| `beads_list` | Bead listing | `--robot-bead-list` |
| `assign` | Work assignment | `--robot-assign` |
| `triage` | Triage analysis | `--robot-triage` |
| `health` | Health check | `--robot-health` |
| `diagnose` | Diagnostic report | `--robot-diagnose` |
| `agent_health` | Agent health | `--robot-agent-health` |
| `is_working` | Working state | `--robot-is-working` |
| `all` | All schemas | - |

### Example Output

```bash
ntm --schema status | jq '.schema.properties | keys'
[
  "_meta",
  "agent_mail",
  "alerts",
  "beads",
  "error",
  "error_code",
  "generated_at",
  "sessions",
  "success",
  "summary",
  "system",
  "timestamp",
  "version"
]
```

### Schema Versioning

All schemas include:
- `$schema`: JSON Schema draft version (draft-07)
- `title`: Human-readable schema title
- Schema output includes `version` field (currently `1.0.0`)
